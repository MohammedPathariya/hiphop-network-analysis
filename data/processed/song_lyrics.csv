J. Cole,No Role Modelz,"December 9, 2014","First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved"
J. Cole,She Knows,"October 29, 2013","She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to Heaven above
But honestly, I never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away, run
 (Oh, I), 
run away, run away
 (Oh, I, I, I)
Run away and never come back
 (Well, alright)
Run, run away, run, run away

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man, what you want?
What you want?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit, huh
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit, but not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good, so them bad hoes try me, they try me, huh
This is Martin Luther King in the club, gettin' dubs, huh
With a bad bitch in his ear, sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down, she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well, alright,

To put a ring on it, uh
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just wanna sing on it, oh, huh
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie, uh
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibe with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was 'sleep, 'cause I
Creep with this pretty young thing that I cho'
'Cause she could be doing the same thing, I suppo'

And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

Well, alright,

Niggas say, ""Turn up,"" hoes say, ""Turn up""
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say, ""Turn up,"" hoes say, ""Turn up""
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)

J. Cole,Power Trip,"February 14, 2013","Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

Got me up all night (All night)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs

Got me open all night, hey

J. Cole,Wet Dreamz,"December 9, 2014","Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no"
J. Cole,Love Yourz,"December 9, 2014","Hm, love yours
Hm, love yours
No such thing

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all (Eh, rah, eh, rah)
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words and listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some my niggas down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairy tale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think bein' broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Ha)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Think bein' broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(Think bein' broke was better, yeah) No such thing, no such thing

For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord (Man) up above
'Cause I been strong so far, but I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good, get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think bein' broke was better, now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV, see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely, and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga, feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive ('Live, 'live, 'live)
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived ('Rived, rived, rived)"

Jennifer Hudson
]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

They tell me I should fix my grill 'cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile

You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful, you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
'Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be
And that's you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round
, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation
That's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil'
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

J. Cole,MIDDLE CHILD,"January 23, 2019","You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel

Money in your palm don't make you real

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you (Feeling you)
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Put yo' motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gon' see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on

And put my number in it—
Huh, I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time
I heard you got a man, but who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine, huh

But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn, she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do

Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat 'em up and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you, nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's an AP, nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga— huh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, ""Thanks for the view,"" waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off

Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

J. Cole,4 Your Eyez Only,"December 9, 2016","Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

Hey, niggas be dyin' on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothin' but a criminal
Control the block, servin' up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they lettin' off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no comin' back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressin' me
Like I ain't the one who put them Js on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screamin', ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wipin' toilets
But these felonies be makin' life the hardest
Resistin' the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike, and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

You prolly grown now, so this song'll hit you
If you hearin' this, unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you
In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me prayin' that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writin' this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizin' in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushin' paraphernalia
But daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin'
Blood was stainin' the concrete
Older niggas I loved, talked like they was above
Maintainin' a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business, by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinkin':
""What the fuck we namin' this girl?""
I told her, ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of (Most prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen)
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm livin' fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catchin' up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand)
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand)
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger-happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blastin' frustrated 'cause the cash runnin' out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time duckin' school, duckin' cops
Duckin' rules, huggin' blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doin' time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearin' 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feelin' your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listenin' now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teachin' you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feelin'
What he'd been dealin' with lately, he wasn't tellin'
I tried to pick his brains, still, he wasn't revealin'
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chillin', he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothin', when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, beggin' you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleepin' at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? Fuck is you gettin' at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been havin' premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feelin' I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm livin' on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leavin' you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, makin' sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy, twelve years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from baggin' up them grams to servin' O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only"

Same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang, nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

We all kings (We all kings, nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game (Hehehaha)
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it (True)
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a bang, the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gon' be no more kings (Ain't gon' be no more kings)
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power (Mm)
In reality he's a coward (Mm)
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side (The other side, ayy)
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I (Yessir)
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God, nigga)
It's for all the kings (Uh)
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved"

J. Cole,1985,"April 20, 2018","1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years, you gon' be on 
Love & Hip-Hop

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—

(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope

J. Cole,A Tale of 2 Citiez,"December 9, 2014","Uh

Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me, my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees, my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need, my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see, my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream (Bad dream, bad dream)
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? (Bad thing, bad thing)
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga, Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me 'til you get it how could you know?
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)

Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Fuck with me, my nigga
We gon' circle 'round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some trees, my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see, my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key, my nigga
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to, nigga
Me, I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too, nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do, nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
It'll haunt you, nigga, haunt you

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things? (What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is, nigga, run that shit right now)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command"
J. Cole,Forbidden Fruit,"June 18, 2013","Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (
Oh no
)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold TECs like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, ""baby, don't yell""
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that

Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch

La la la (Yeah)
La la la la la (Yeah)

I grew up, a fucking screw up, tie my shoe up
Wish they was newer, damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now, I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm tryna stay alive, in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? (La la la)
Ayy, who am I? (La la la la la, yeah)

Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way
My nigga  slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CDs and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peeped game, got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard, pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her, ""Hello"", and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, ""What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on,"" he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing, his demeanor said more
He told me, ""Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be, that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You 'bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us, why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?

Things change, rearrange and so do I (Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?)

Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here

Mmm
)
See, I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand (
Mmm

The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife  (
Mmm

To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard  (
Mmm

I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates (
Mmm

Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel, 'cause I'm supposed to have a halo (
Mmm
)
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly (
Mmm
)
Fiends wan' get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do? I just supply
It's economics, my business ain't got the suit and tie (
Oh, wait

Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine (
Oh, wait

I can't oblige, dawg, I work too hard

Prodigal son, got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo, lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain 
myself
?
If I fall, dust it off and regain 
myself
Fuck them all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved (
Ooh
)
I no longer bury demons
I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing (
Ooh
)

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more, yeah, yeah

I, I, yeah

You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little

Oh, no

Oh, oh, no

""Time is short,"" that's what somebody told me (
Told me, oh

I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Ayy, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands (
Ooh
)
All of a sudden, niggas poppin' trunk and then we scram (
Mmm
)
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man (
Ooh, yeah
)
Eyes wide, that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills (
Ooh
)
Bloodshed done turned the city to a battlefield (
Mmm
)
I call it poison, you call it real, that's how you feel?
(Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop)

Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
(
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
) Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, 'cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was twenty-two
(Last night at around 7:45) He was twenty-two
(Twenty-two year old black male, suspect, reporting on the news)

(I swear to God, bruh, no)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr. (No)
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro)
We got to do better, people
Twenty-two years old, this boy was too young (Oh my God)
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentlemen
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words (I'ma kill them niggas)
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—"
J. Cole,January 28th,"December 9, 2014","Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window 'cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights full of Hennessy
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the god
Nah you ain't the god
Nigga, Cole the god (Cole the god, Cole the god)

J. Cole,Immortal,"December 9, 2016","Awwwww...haha

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""Dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga, I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M, nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin, nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean?

Real niggas don't die

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""Sell dope, rap or go to NBA""
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen"

I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob? Who you had to fuck
Just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money; escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear - goin' broke, 'cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't trippin'
Nigga Jordan, I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slippin', tears
Blood, sweat, and I ain't crippin', here's
A song you can sing along wit'
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home 'cause she got a second job
Deliverin' pizzas, you think she out there gettin' robbed
Please God, watch her, I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talkin' all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg
I'm a grown man now, I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty, now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writin' rhymes, try and bring back the hope
Tried to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Coulda drowned, but I grabbed the rope

And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew

Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But e'ry fuckin' verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit, you try switch now
Know you felt the shit just now
Know you felt the shit just now, ha
Ain't there more to you?
Don't it ever get borin' to you?
I realize deep down you a coward gettin' high off of power
Fuck it more to you, saw through you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect, but it came with fame
I just wanted love, but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane and watched lil Jermaine
Do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat, he gave it all he got
And now the nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be rainin' in
Spend a hundred thou' for the chain again
Think of old-school niggas like Dana Dane
Prolly kill for another claim to fame, my brain just sayin'
""Yeah, nigga, least he ain't insane
Least he ain't insane""
You ain't crazy, ma'fucker, you just 'fraid of change, ayy
That's new
Maybe that's true
But listen here, I got a bigger fear:
One day that I become you when I become lost
And I become heartless
And numb from all the ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now, I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
'Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme, I know
Money can't save your soul

But there go you
There go you
There go you
Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew
And there go you

No fly zone, please stay the fuck out my airspace (Out my face)
Niggas say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (Dare say)
Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace
Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'

You niggas just cubs but no, not the ones in the big leagues
After 
The Fall Off
, I promise I'm comin' to sellin' out Wrigley's
Nigga, I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics to profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty

Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently
Never seen no one drivin' a Bentley
I can't be out here moppin' up Wendy's

My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (
Come from

So often

People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

Say what? The stuff that I've seen got me traumatized
I let the K go when Johnny died
Swangin' that muhfucka' side to side
We don't participate, ain't with that squashin' shit, all we believe in is homicide
I got a good heart, so I send teddy bears every time we make they mommas cry
I pray that my past ain't ahead of me (21)
When I'm in love, I love heavily (On God)
If you betray me, you dead to me (21)
I disrespect you respectfully (Straight up)
I got some partners who left this Earth
Maybe the pain made a better me (On God)
Just know that they secrets is kept with me (On God)
I feel like the streets is in debt with me (Straight up)
I gave my heart away to all the dawg hoes 'cause that's who accepted me (21)
I blame my pops for that shit 'cause if he didn't fail, he could've corrected me (21)
Give all the props to my momma 'cause no matter what, she always protected me (On God)
I promise you, it ain't no checkin' me (On God)
Jump in the water, get wet with me (Straight up, 21, 21)
You want my money or wanna have sex with me?
Can't let the opps or the law get the best of me
I get to answerin', you get to testin' me
I see chicken, you niggas is breast to me
Planted a seed but it ain't a sesame
Can't let you niggas or bitches grow next to me

J. Cole,Let Nas Down,"June 18, 2013","Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born, same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped 
Stillmatic
, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'da thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play and
I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, soundin' sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, ""You the one, yo, why you make that shit?""
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made ""You Owe Me"", dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par when I followed my heart?
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind that kept on sayin', ""Where's the hits? You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none,""
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcomes, huh
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, studied they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights
 blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game
But on the way I let Nas down
Damn, I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open the door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OGs for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?

Letting Nas down
I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Story begin"
J. Cole,False Prophets,"December 1, 2016","Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it

I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?

These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it

Sometimes I brag like Hov, now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Cole, time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

Sometimes I brag like Hov, sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot
Okay, faggot? Uh
Don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass, that's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute, that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it, nigga, nigga, nigga
Used to watch 
Rap City
, Big Tigga, Tigga
Rap nerd, even copped Rah Diggah, Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know in a year he'd be fucking paying me, what could you say to me? I
Beat the odds like Vegas, I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me, now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I’m probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him

Keep on asking me about the Illuminati;
Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would've been a summa cuma laude
Beyoncé told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars

Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends

Re-adjustin' my target audience, 'cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer

Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose

I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

She hugs him (You kiss me)
You tell me you miss me

Just got off the phone, my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency
Said, ""Most of these niggas gon' hang they selves, just give 'em the rope and see""
Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me
Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back

Scrapin' up whatever coin they can find, the pettiest crime, they committin' it
Just to get by for a limited time, the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb

Should this be my last breath I'm blessed 'cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship, Lord, but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers?
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point is right to ""Be all that you can be"" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing

I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music biz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming, ""Don't let me slip""
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you, ""You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane,"" my roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke, you go broke with me
I smoke, you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby, you go Whitney, damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be

J. Cole,Snow On Tha Bluff,"June 16, 2020","Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet,"" most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like, ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough

The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today

Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive"
J. Cole,In the Morning,"November 12, 2010","Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But, well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees, gettin' lifted
I quit, but, shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause, girl, I caught the vibes like you threw somethin' to me, so I threw 'em back
Now all my niggas hollerin', ""Who was that?""
""Oh boy, she bad, nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?""
I'm finna take you home and sip a little Patrón, now we zonin'
Baby, you're so fine

And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you're moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Ayy, can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you're moanin'

Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work, I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gon' love it, yeah
When light's comin' through the drapes and we're both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin', yeah

Can I hit it in the mornin'? Yeah
Can I hit it in the mornin'? Yeah
The sun risin' while you're moanin'
Baby, can I hit it in the mornin'? Uh
Can I hit it in the mornin'? Yeah
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you're moanin' (Hey, hey)

God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patrón
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see, my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yet
Somehow, I wound up in your bed, so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you're through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' 'bout, tomorrow, you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight, we gettin' right until the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'

And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you're moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?

Bright lights pass me in the city, it’s emеrgency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency
Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame of sin and cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up in hell and poverty
Pride make a nigga feel a way that you unfollow me
Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be
Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy
Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery
Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy
Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies
Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be
It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me

Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette
I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet

I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense

I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it
Will I be destroyed?

Just last week, seen yo' mama weep
Crying 'cause she don't wan' bury your brother
The blood lеaks while the EMTs
Gotta carry her baby likе surrogate mothers
Woah, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered
Though traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Through hard times, it was there I discovered
A hustle and makin' the best out the struggle

It's a war, niggas runnin' up the score

Was his niggas gettin' murdered every week?
Dead bodies, smell the odor in the street

He sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry

I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly, I feel like we ain't ready and this—
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world

What's the way out?

Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
‘Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit

But he loved her ‘cause the pussy good

Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': ""Is it even mine?""
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', ‘cause he actin' distant
Like, ""Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different.""
And all his niggas sayin', ""Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures.""
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion

Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4"" rappers

Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back

On the first night, and nah, I ain't proud of it

And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist, nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative, nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call, she was hurtin'

They act like they don't even fuckin' speak English

Bitch, my pen to the paper's lethal
I'm sendin' 'em straight to meet the
The nigga that made them, peep the reaper
Creepin' on ya, the scent of failure reekin' on ya
Check your genitalia, pussy-niggas bleedin' on yourself
Fuckin' with Cole is bold, but it's impedin' on your health
All yo' niggas eatin' off your wealth
All my niggas feedin' all they selves, and it feels swell
Krispy Kreme dreams, sometime my dawgs wanna kill 12 (Uh)
'Cause they steady harassin'
We seen dilemmas like Nelly and Kelly that end in the deadliest fashion
My young niggas nutty, they blastin'
Bullets be hummin' like Cudi, put one in yo' hoodie, Spaghetti-O splashin'
All over the driveway, y'all talkin' all sideways
Shots poppin' off, y'all laid down
Cops chalkin' off y'all legs now
(Shit) God watchin', ""Hey, Yahweh""
My niggas looked up to the sky like we sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)
We sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)

That's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all see what the fuck goin' on out here (Killa, Harlem)
I-95 shit, Carolina, 2-6, stand up, nigga
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Represent your shit, motherfucker
Represent your shit, motherfucker
Represent your clique, motherfucker

J. Cole,Runaway,"June 18, 2013","Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they? You see 'em with their wife, ""What's up Tony?"" ""Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright."" You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, ""What's up Tony?"" ""Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!""

Yeah
Gimme my space, Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, ""Don't wait up""
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, ""Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?""
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
I'm running away

Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: ""Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?""
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit
Like, ""What the fuck is a break? Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more""
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

Yeah
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, ""Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is""
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know

Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on"
J. Cole,Sparks Will Fly,"June 18, 2013","It may seem like our fire

And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

Baby you deserve the whole enchilada
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave a note
Know you was tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this song
Thought they knew me well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
But happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick, fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I am perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip, only girl in my life is you

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

Feels as though our world's crashing down
We can’t forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
It’ll get better

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly"

Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, pro'bly make a gay nigga reconsider
You're now rockin' with the best, mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed, mane, let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she's fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl, 'cause a nigga don't play them ex games
Nope, straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain't coming off of my last name, 'cause I really can't take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, ""He a bad boy""
But I'm signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids

She said
""I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes

Hoes holla, 'cause they love my sound and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night, that'll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight, tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight, on the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches

Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothin' sunny, I see 'em hating, but it ain't nuttin' to me
I'm from the Ville where they bang for the money and carry fo'-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred? Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track, I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr

Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you

Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift? (Am I strong enough to lift?)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)
Am I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)
Am I strong enough to lift (Am I strong enough to lift)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)

Ib gon' ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
That's the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit, hey, mama, look what God made
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin', baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes

There is a God, it is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive

Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CDs
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga
Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga
But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga
Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga

Talk about it)
Fuck do you know ‘bout my dreams?

But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand

It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga

I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate

Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

Bring the 7

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
She bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
""I heard he do drugs now""
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey-dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
""Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?""
""She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony""
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh, ooh)
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

The Weeknd,Sidewalks,"November 25, 2016","Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yup)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Sidewalks saved my life (Sidewalks saved my life)
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life (Sidewalks saved my life)
They show me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down

'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I say that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me

The Weeknd,The Morning,"January 3, 2011","I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding

It's all the same (It's all the same)
I'm always ready to take a life again (That life again)
You know I'll ride again (I'll ride again)
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

Who gon' pray for me? Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you, if I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey

I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today, I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture's comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be
Sacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be

Who gon' pray for me? Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you, if I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey

Hey, hey (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Hey, hey (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Hey, hey (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Who gon' pray for me? Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you, if I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey

Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law

The Weeknd,Kiss Land,"May 17, 2013","When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my...
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home

'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)

(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back

You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, I'm tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said, I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'

I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long, I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones and
Probably not if my niggas round them up and
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep

This ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried

Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah"

Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous (Oh!)
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin' (Feeling like I'm dyin')
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher (Get me higher)
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private (Oh!)
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like it)

Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow

I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Well, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

I've been sober for a year, now it's time for me
To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you

I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smilin'
While I'm dyin'
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blindin'
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when

I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Girl, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

I lost my faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
Faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love

I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up (I ended up), in the back of a flashing car (Back of a flashing car)"

She pulled up to the studio
Nobody's watching
She closed the door and then she locked it
For me, for me
We had sex in the studio
Nobody walked in
I cut my verse and then she popped it
For me, for me
LA girls all look the same
I can't recognize
The same work done on they face
I don't criticize
She a cold-hearted bitch with no shame
But her throat too fire
She got Chrome Hearts hangin' from her neck
And them shits going wild
When she ride, she hold tight
She gon' ride 'til sweat fall down her spine
She's all mine for the night
She's all mine until he calls her line

She pulled up to the studio
Nobody's watching
She closed the door and then she locked it
For me, for me
We had sex in the studio
Nobody walked in
I cut my verse and then she popped it

The Weeknd,Initiation,"October 8, 2011","Oh, yeah, got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit so foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby, get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that XO
She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down, you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished, we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys

And you've been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
'Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you thirsty
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up your teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that back 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you

Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now

And I woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

And I woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night"

Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten, but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up,"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D.​
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Brand-new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
Twenty-five hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you

Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did

And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you"

What's happenin', Chi Chi?
)

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit

Lil Baby,The Bigger Picture,"June 12, 2020","Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (
Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up
)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here

That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OGs salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel

I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a GOAT, I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people

I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit

Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap

I bring up hits and they change up the topic

Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover

Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother (Shh-shh)
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper

Sound like it could be 
Drip Season
 or somethin'
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the Dawn
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you upset that I'm shinin' in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, ""Fuck it"", I'm goin' on the run
You one of my dawgs, I'll look out for the bond

Let 'em get by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dick ride
Breadwinner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Go at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me ""No"" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us

Let 'em get by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size

Three hundred racks inside it, and that ain't no cap
I could've bought a Wraith today, yeah yeah
I ran it up, they supposed to hate
I'm digging this lifestyle
Water drippin' on me like I'm a faucet
The crew with me right now
You can play, just proceed with caution
I popped the wrong pill, now I'm nauseous
I need to get off this drank, it's a problem
I took a Tesla and landed on Mars​
Lord please wake me up tomorrow

She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas

Diamonds on Fiji, I'm running with QC
And Reebok endorse me, went up a new level
I'm loving this lifestyle and niggas wanna be me
I know they won't catch up, but I ain't gon' let 'em
As soon as the money get up to a million, put it in the ground and then go buy a new shovel
How you gon' be in yo feelings when I'm in my feelings?
We both can't be in our feelings
I ain't gon' lie when you thinkin' I did it, I did it
It's something 'bout your intuition
Ain't telling you no lies, I'm tired of seeing you cry
Come here girl, let me wipe your eye
Everything gon' be alright, yeah

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

I paid some extra before we even come out
And don't even wear it to show I ain't playin'
I hit the bitch and I gave her some racks
And I pull up my pants, she know I ain't stayin'
Go on a store run and get rubber bands
I done got rich, I done put on my mans
Choppers in traffic, that's just how I'm livin'
They say that I'm trippin', they wouldn't understand
She take a trip, she come back with a tan
I take a trip, I come back with them bands
When I was dealin', it really was killin' 'em
Had 'em competin', tryna see what I'm payin'
She throw a hoodie on soon as we land
She don't like pics, I got too many fans
I'm runnin' shit, I can do what I want
And it's really a limit, you do what you can
I found the booth and I put that shit up
'Fore I run out of cash, they gonna run out of land
I fell in love with this bitch 'cause her head was amazing
I swear I don't even know her name
I'm 'bout to takeoff, I gave 'em a chance
They gave me ten M&M's on advance
Thought I'd be trappin' forever, but God came and blessed me
I guess it was part of the plan
How he on fire, but he cool as a fan?
Can't get at you, we gon' get at your man
They can relate to me 'cause I be poppin' it
Put in they face, let 'em see what I'm sayin'
I'm rockin' shows like I play with a band
Free all the bros, know I would if I can
If I don't mean it, I swear I ain't sayin' it
'Fore I was 21, swear I was savage, smashin'

Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

We got FN with extensions, we throwin' that
Her ass got my full attention, she throwin' that
Niggas talkin' way too much, I ain't goin' back
And forth with niggas 'cause these niggas be holdin' racks
On the real, yeah, we know you don't own them racks
Four pockets full, push 'em down, they start pokin' back
I turned eight million right until I'm a quarterback
Spent a million like I'm tryna bring Kobe back (24, woo)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I use the crockpot like it's Betty
They say the drop hot and it's ready
Might stretch it out, but it ain't fetti (Yes)
Say my dawg doin' time
But I know he ain't gonna snitch 'cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me
My dawg stabbed his celly
He told me the whole story over the celly (Brr, hello?)
Went up on my price, in my pocket like Kelly
Fucked her in the telly, no I can't not say who, no telly
My head gettin' heavy
And you know I still got Balmains on my ass (Woo)
No, I can't do no Amiris
Said I'm takin' trips, long flights, they scary
She said her birthday in March, okay, cool, so that means you an Aries
I told her, ""Gotta go,"" she said, ""You serious?""
Diamonds cold as December, my vibe Sagittarius

Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up (
Haha, period, period, slatt, woo

Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

I can switch up and come back another way
If the vibe ain't right, come back another day
Biggest dripper, I start up a tidal wave
Remix weed, we put it in a microwave
Batch for twenty-three like I know Michael J
He can say what he want, but he gotta pay
Used to hide all the guns where my mama stay
Sell my drugs 'round the corner
I pay all these bills, I'm a grownup
My cars a lil' different, I own 'em
I ain't with no leasin', my bitch tellin' me I need credit
It's loud and clear if I said it
I come from the gutter, I spent me a hundred on Chevys
You can take me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out of me
Know the hood proud of me
I Givenchyed my tee, went and upgrade my teeth
Yeah, I dropped out of school, but that paper on me

Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me

I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back
Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

All she want me to do is keep it real
She keep on cryin' I'm tired of her tears
I keep on lyin' it just what it is

I got some homies who sittin' in the pen

Lil Baby,Heyy,"October 10, 2022","Yeah

My favorite bitch just cut me off and she won't even let me know the reason (Yeah)
It's probably one of her lil' messy hatin'-ass friends bein' evil
I ain't stressin' 'bout it, she'll come around when she wanna eat it up
Slow stroke, fast stroke, grindin' it, I'm a real pleaser
Sixty hoes in New York havin' dinner
Bottega send it to me soon as they get it
I put Maybach seats in the Sprinter
Make sure evеrybody sit comfortable
You gotta really pay attention, I'm not mumblin'
Shе tryna have a good time, she wanna come with us
They know we can't be fucked with, they not one of us
It's done been some times I slipped, I'm not fallin'
Brabus baby blue, the inside too, I'm feelin' like a kid again
They thought I got lucky last time, fuck it, I'm back on that shit again
Her last bag was a crocodile Kelly
Got it chocolate to match her skin
I just gave bro a hundred pounds of wham
Told him, ""Tell the city it's in""
Majority of the time, I ""Hi"" and ""Bye,"" these niggas
I ain't with all that lockin' in shit
Money over everything, try to stop it
You get popped right then and there
Message thread full of, ""Where you ats?"" and ""Pull up on me""
Bunch of whens and wheres
Youngins out here wildin' with no guidance
All they care about is who they kill
I was tryna keep that shit in order
It got harder 'cause I'm never there
It's a better life out here
I promise, brodie, I'ma keep it in they ear
I know how it feel to spin a opp
But it feel way better to count a million
I come from the bottom of the bottom
I shot right up through the fuckin' ceilin'

Hey (Hey-hey-hey)

Yeah, stay down, hustle hard until you come up
Take some, only when you need it
You won't make it far bein' greedy
My grandma taught me how to be a leader
If we fly commercial, we got greeters
They just know that we important people
They see how we comin', think we ghetto
Until they children tell 'em I'm their hero
Flight attendant said I look familiar
Crack a smile, tell her, ""It's a small world""
Oh, that's your bitch? That's my ho too
We gon' share her, call her, ""Our girl""
Real street music, I ran that field
If you can hit that, then she ain't my girl
Get your lick back, come step in my world
Two bitches on the same itinerary
The same flight, same hotel, they don't even know each other yet (Yeah)
One of 'em don't say nothin', the other askin', ""Do we go together yet?""
Young turnt nigga, ain't no holdin' back
This a Brabus, bro, not a regular wagon
I don't kiss and tell, I ain't into that
I don't think I met a nigga colder yet, like

Hellcat faster than a Demon, new G-Wagen with no key
Put baguettes in my AP, I ain't on playin' about they beef
Niggas know I play for keeps, treat my brothers like they me
Had to make myself a boss, it ain't no nigga workin' me
I invest a couple mil' and let my money work for me
Know they hate the way it happened, probably somewhere cursin' me
I don’t know nothing ’bout no killin', all I know is murder beats
I got rich and understand my next three cars gon’ be a lease
I ain't never losin' sleep about no beef, I roll in peace
I put diamonds in my teeth, came from grindin' in the streets
Get a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it
Pray to God for all the dawgs behind the wall, they need they freedom (Free y’all)
When I be on TV and perform, I hope they see me (See me)
Once it's up, it's stuck, we get over on niggas, not get even

Really from the trenches, turn a dollar to a nickel (Get 'em)
Baddest of the baddest, guess I gotta wait to pick 'em

Turn my name to ""The kiDD,"" that's a baby goat
Keep a Drac' like I started up OVO
You can get a percent, but I want the most
Got a house with a lake, so I bought a boat
'Bout to switch up a play, that's an audible
State-to-state, private jet with some model hoes
Had to run up more dollars than followers
Me and bae take the week off in Cabo
Life's a gamble, I'm playin' the lotto
I'm bettin' it all 'cause I know that I got 'em
'Member me? I was drivin' Impalas
We don't beef, if it's problems, we solve it
I remember that deucе deuce revolvеr I bought for my partna
He died in a argument
They was hatin', that's why I'm way farther than 'em
'Member askin' my mom where my father been at
Ain't no talkin', that fire what I'm tryna get at
Niggas cuffin' these hoes that the crew done been had
Get them racks out the bank, put it right in the bag
Say he wouldn't do that, but he would if he can
Hop out marchin' with drums like we play in the band
I come straight out the mud, I ain't been in no sand
Twenty-hour flight, had popped me a Xan
I got horny, almost fucked on a fan
I had thinked about it, I can't end up on Shade Room
Everything that I hit, I done paid for
She know what I can bring to the table
I can tell if it's real by the label
We had TV, but we didn't have cable

I'm with the killas forever, the trenches is in me
The Grammys can't change me for nothin'
I like the bitches who let me just offer them cash
You never gon' ask me for nothin'
Never gon' switch
Only time I ever switch is a Glock with a motherfuckin' button
Rappers be runnin' back, tellin' them bitches we hittin'
That's why we don't be tellin' them nothin'

Clique full of killas, we choosin' to shoot 'em
Someone tell Kanye and Kim to just stick to the script

Anything good in my way came from God
Go get on stage and I get an applause

Back to back the coupes, they know it's us
My bro took a loss and I picked him up
We stick together, they ain't rich as us
I wanna sit down, she ain't lit enough

Every situation ever happened, Baby played his part
I ain't never did shit to brag about it, I do that shit with honors
In my bag, but I been layin' back, I'm turnin' up this summer
Guess you mad 'cause I've been havin', tellin' hoes I was a runner
If I was, I was the richest runner in Georgia, on my mama
And I ain't never been no worker, had my own number, ask bruh
Seven summers straight we went crazy, called it good luck

I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble, yeah

Thinkin' 'bout that shit you said, I can't get it out my head
I know that my heart is black, so all my cars' insides is red
I don't wanna argue with no one, let's get this guap instead
I ain't tryna beef with none these niggas 'cause all my opps is dead
If you ever run into police, you better not tell
Turn it up, I might as well, you know I'm so 4PF
'Fore I go, I gotta say what's up to all the bros in jail
I know that they be listenin', I know that he'll be with me
And his lawyer cost one-sixty, I hope they un-convict him when he go back
Follow him with a low jack, then step on him like a doormat
Doin' dirt, can't go back, my mind straight, ain't no slackin'
Guns all in Renee house, you ain't from the hood if you don't know Madison

I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble, yeah"

How you bring a knife to a gunfight?
They gon' always do it twice when it's done right
I remember ridin' 'round 'til the sunlight come up
I ain't tryna argue so I hung up
D-boy fresh with it on me, know how I pop out
If bullshit is not important, what I'm gon' lie 'bout?
Don't play with Baby, I give you somethin' to cry 'bout
That's a dime, that's for you and four of your friends to fly out
Every time we outside, that shit be goin' up
I got women tryna get at me like you been growin' up
Really, I know you see what's happenin', I'm steady blowin' up
I know niggas want me to fall but I'm steady goin' uphill
Started from the bottom, how the fuck I'm up here?
If you rеally came from nothin', then you know how that feel
Ain't no extras, only stеppers, that's the way that I live
Put some extras on it, blessed it, nigga, that's what I did
Heart cold frozen, got my mindset on where on however this shit go
Still kinda nervous hopin' nobody would notice it
At the point, I met you, slowed me down
You fuckin' up my focus, bro, I'm really on some more shit
Ain't been on the scene that much, I'm somewhere gettin' loaded
Ain't talkin' 'bout weed that I smoked or lean that I po'd
I'm talkin' 'bout this money I'm savin' up, I been in the tuck
Fuckin' with me, winin' the lottery, ayy, who feelin' lucky?
Know some real ones ready to slide with me if I press the button
People who done really been down from me, they don't ask for nothin'
Keepin' it one million, I'm too real to say that I'm one hundred
You are not the one 'cause you got money, real shit

I don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up
You see how we walked in? You can't see we run stuff?
I gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up
Glad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster
I done seen this shit get grimy, I can't have no conscience
See 'em tryna clone me and all, but it's only one me
If I came in this world alone, why I get lonely?
Can someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen

I don't feel a lot of this shit, I can't even hold you
Catch me in the Hamptons with Mike Rubin or HOV them
Or catch me in the hood with a Lamborghini with the doors up
I can't even lie, it broke my heart, I heard you told some
Gotta keep my fire under my jacket, it's a cold world
She with me when he go out to practice, this a cold girl
She a goblin, she don't even stop it, make your toes curl
Bae, I'm sorry for puttin' our business out there
You too cool for a loser, you could be winnin' out here
You keep it wet, I'm gon' invest, support yo' swimmin' line
Don't worry 'bout that, just do yo' best, I promise you'll be fine
You let that shit come out yo' mouth, now you can't press rewind, it's stuck there
Five million cash, all blues, you get a rush, yeah
I don't need a nigga or a bitch, who the fuck cares?
You the one that's really sour, I ain't even gon' go there
You was 'posed to be here, but oh well

I don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up
You see how we walked in? You can't see we run stuff?
I gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up
Glad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster

Ride on the back of that bitch like some pegs

poverty

I'm so glad I made it through the rain
They don't wanna see a nigga straight
They don't wanna see young Gunna paid
Take a long time, I had to wait
Want this penthouse, a lot of space
A lot of hundreds comin' our way
Bust it down, split it with the gang

I used to sleep on the floor for a mattress
Getting evicted, that shit was embarrassing
My mama didn't have it, we made us a palettes
I had to share with the roaches and rats
Keep gettin' money these voices keep telling me
I went to prison, it made me a better me
I can't get no job, I got too many felonies
I been on probation since I was like seventeen
I done got me some stripes in the hood like a referee
I used to walk into school with that fire on me

Missed out on my kids' life for a year and I gotta accept it
Certain days niggas never came to my shows and I felt neglected
Growin' up, seein' my uncle dyin' in his bed, that shit made me reckless
Pourin' up and I ain't never sharin' my meds, and I ain't bein' extra
And I paid like two of my niggas bonds before I bought a necklace
I done seen my brother stack his bricks up and it look like Tetris
Havin' real shootout up on the e-way, you can't miss your exit
Told the bitch she can't hide the smеll of my cologne, she gotta go change hеr panties
Take care of your family and them kids 'cause I'm too big on family
Fuck them fast cars, before that shawty 'nem was gon' slide in Camrys
I'ma give my lawyer an extra dub because it come in handy
Felt like I'ma vomit off this Perc' 'cause I don't take no Xannies

I put niggas on, and all of a sudden they feel entitled
Put the Brabus on it, you only get this kit when you got a title
I'm exhausted, I been workin' shift-to-shift, but I keep fightin'
Not my fault if I don't miss your likeness
And I'm still with Ced still
We the ones, for real, for real
I just got two hundred for a walk through, I'll still drill
High-speed chases in a Dodge Stratus, I can still peel 'em
I be tryna put on a smile for 'em but I don't really feel 'em
I just spent three-fifty on a Richard for the second time
I showed all my niggas in the trenches it's a better life
Never get too big for me to listen, I'll take your advice
I just told Durk, ""We rich forever if we play it right""
Just keep on bein' the voice, I'll be the hero
And everything I got is a profit, started with zero
I can never turn my back on my apartment, that's where I come from
And I'm just gettin' started, relax, wait 'til I warm up

I done been to jail too many times, it feel like karma
Everywhere I sleep, I keep my stick, what I need an alarm for?
Police caught me in the cut, I had to walk out with my arms up
Ain't too big to pray last minute, I put my palms up
Yeah, flood my system with these Percies
Took the bitch to eat out at Thirteen, she was squirtin'
I just cashed out on my bitch, Celine to match her Birkin
All this shit these bitches textin' me, just do it in person

Yeah, I might pop a half an Adderall, I don't like Percies
Put the phone on DND, I'm somewhere in her cervix
I just slimed a nigga out today but it was worth it
I switch cars like bitches switch they purses
I slow down on features, I do verses if they worth it now
This shit done got deep and it's beyond us, we can't work it out
Peeped that lately you been actin' funny, wonder what it's 'bout

If it ain't color, what's the difference from you and I?

Ain't no tellin' where I be if I ain't have God or ain't have my team
Can't let 'em trick me out the streets, I got a mind of my own

I even told you hoes I hear some shit I'm 'posed to kept on the low
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)

I'll make a scene for you
When you sleeping with me, then your dreams come true
Ain't no limitations to things we do
Wе just kickin', and now she'll be lovin' me soon
I bе straight to the point, ain't no cut on a movie
Fuckin' her good all over the room
Make her nut, she'll lay there, she don't even move
I gotta go, but I'm coming back soon
Don't tell our business, you know that's the rules
It feel good to tell someone to Google you
I tell 'em, ""Chill,"" 'cause I know what they'll do to you
I run Atlanta, get paid like I'm Julio
We made a way from the streets to the studio
Anyone feelin' me, that's who I do it for
You can't just pop out and say you the hero
You gotta put on a cape and save the day
Shawty my type, she ain't got no stomach
Look her dead in the face when I'm cummin'
Send a video, and tell me she want it
Just the other day, I gave her some money
Plead the fifth, I ain't making no comment
If it happened to them niggas, we done it
Too much shit to step for, I can't be runnin'
Boy, don't make me fly your bitch out the country

She tryna fuck me when I'm fastin', she can't come around no more
Walked in the house, my pants unfasten, then she swear I was with a ho
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)
I can't split rent with my lil' bitch, that's some shit you would do to a ho
I even told you hoes I hear some shit I'm 'posed to kept on the low
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)

Never lied to me when I asked you something
No matter what, you just be real with me
A lot of shit come with a nigga like me
I just hope that you learn how to deal with me
I only be out with a couple of niggas
Now shit bound to happen whenever we deep
I run with some hitters, they run from a camera
And they won't even take a picture with me
The teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up, I stood up and told her ""Big Meech""
My mama ain't have much, and I wasn't good at no sports, so you know, I had fell to the streets
And I ain't no Chef Boyardee, but I get me a lil' bit of food, I'ma make sure we eat
And that shit be crazy how we used to swap our spit with each other, we don't even speak
Come with me, we'll be gone for months
My lil' shorty, show her how to roll blunts
Hit Rodeo, let her get what she like
Drop a bag on her, she get excited
Tryna steal her heart, I'm on a heist
I only trust her, long as she in my sight
One thing she know, we in this shit for life

She tryna fuck me when I'm fastin', she can't come around no more
Walked in the house, my pants unfasten, then she swear I was with a ho
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)
I can't split rent with my lil' bitch, that's some shit you would do to a ho

Bookin' on my schedule, I ain't rich enough to chill out
I watched you turn sour, I still don't know how to feel 'bout it
Majority of 'em folded, but I'm still solid

I'm still out here, still don't know how to feel about it
Early in the mornin' talkin' to Marquis about it
Wonderin', ""Should I let it go, or, we beefin' 'bout it?""
Knowin' that I'll go cold on you for weeks about it
And it weren't even that deep, but, that's just how it be with me
I can't lie, she be fuckin' me good, but, girl, you fuck me better
I'm not surprised that you stereotypin' to be a lil' guy
But, if I can have a second of yo' time, try to elevate yo' mind
We can crush 'em on every level, I'm tellin' you
I fell in love with generatin' revenue
I know they gon' try to push you from the top, so I'm careful

I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)


I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and woah
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go

Drake,Back To Back,"July 29, 2015","Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from 
Views
, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)"
Drake,Family Matters,"May 3, 2024","Maybe in this song, you shouldn't start by saying
Nigga, I said it, I know that you mad
I've emptied the clip over friendlier jabs
You mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad
I gotta go bad, I gotta go bad

Mm, mm, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot
Drop a fifty bag, 29 for the thot
Uh, I was really, really tryna keep it PG
I was really, really tryna keep it PG
If you had a set, they'd give your ass a DP
But you civilian gang, in real life, you PC

You know who really bang a set? My nigga YG
You know who really bang a set? My nigga Chuck T
You know who even bang a set out there is CB
And, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me
You better have some paperwork or that shit fake tea
Can't bе rappin' 'bout no rattin' that we can't read
I mean it's truе a nigga slimed me for my AP
Just like how Metro nigga slimed him for his main squeeze
Out here beggin' for attention, nigga, say please
Always rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed
You just actin' like an activist, it's make-believe
Don't even go back to your hood and plant no money trees
Say you hate the girls I fuck, but what you really mean?
I been with Black and white and everything that's in between
You the Black messiah wifin' up a mixed queen
And hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem
On some Bobby shit, I wanna know what Whitney need
All that puppy love was over in y'all late teens
Why you never hold your son and tell him, ""Say cheese""?
We could've left the kids out of this, don't blame me
You a dog and you know it, you just play sweet
Your baby mama captions always screamin', ""Save me""
You did her dirty all your life, you tryna make peace
I heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free
Don't make it Dave Free's
'Cause if your GM is your BM secret BD
Then this is all makin' plenty fuckin' sense to me
Ayy, let that shorty breathe
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake, now shake that ass for free
Yeah, yeah
Well, not that kind of free, I'm talkin' 'bout my nigga Dave
Your man a lil' K, we call that shit a mini Drac'
He always said I overlooked him, I was starin' straight
These bars go over Kenny head no matter what I say
I know you like to keep it short, so let me paraphrase
Knew it was smoke when Abel hit us with the serenade
Nigga said, ""Uh, uh""
Almost started reachin' for my waist

Drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot
Drop a fifty bag, 29 for the thot
Uh, I was really, really tryna keep it—


Yeah
Let me stop playin' around, let me take this shit serious, like
Niggas is a joke, I take it serious, though
Yeah, look

If Drake shooters doing TikToks, nigga
Realest shooter in your gang, that's P's brother, y'all ain't getting shit shot, nigga
Can't listen to the stick talk in falsetto, save it for a hip-hop nigga
You don't even be at home, dog, you a souvenir-out-the-gift-shop nigga
Still mad about that one ho, we ain't even fuck, I just lip-locked with her
I get active when it's war time, I ain't even really let my dick drop, nigga
What the fuck I heard Rick drop, nigga? Talkin' somethin' 'bout a nose job, nigga
Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy and doctor never told y'all niggas
Put a nigga in the bars, let a nigga rot, kind of like your old job, nigga
House sittin' on some land, but it's out where no one even really know y'all niggas
Bitches gotta drive two hours 'fore you pay 'em just to give a blowjob, nigga
Must've snorted up a snowball
'Cause my last record deal was four hundred M's, these days, that's a low ball, nigga
Ayy
Who's next on the list?
Which one of my so-called niggas
Which one of my so-called niggas
Which one of my so-called niggas need a shell from the clip?
Always knew I had to smoke y'all niggas
​good kid, m.A.A.d city
 van, we'll pop the latch and let the door slide
Tears runnin' down my cheek, laughin' at you pussies dyin', it's a war cry
Weeknd music gettin' played in all the spots where boys got a little more pride
That's why all your friends dippin' to Atlanta, payin' just to find a tour guide
Abel, run your fuckin' bread, need to buy some more chains for some more guys
Let me find another street nigga I can take to the game courtside
Let me get a used Ferrari for a rapper, take the nigga on a horse ride
Anything to take the spotlight off the fact the boss is a drugged-out lil' punk sissy from the Northside
Rakim talkin' shit again
Gassed 'cause you hit my BM first, nigga, do the math, who I was hittin' then?
I ain't even know you rapped still 'cause they only talkin' 'bout your 'fit again
Probably gotta have a kid again 'fore you think of droppin' any shit again
Even when you do drop, they gon' say you should've modeled 'cause it's mid again
Smokin' Fenty 'bout it, should've put you on the first one, tryna get it in
Ask Fring if this a good idea the next time you cuddled in that bed again
She'll even tell you leave the boy alone 'fore you get your head split again
Pluto shit make me sick to my stomach, we ain't never really been through it
Leland Wayne, he a fuckin' lame, so I know he had to be an influence
These niggas had a plan and they finally found a way to rope you into it
Two separate albums dissin', I just did a Kim to it, nigga, skim through it
Me and Savage had the hoes drippin' wet at shows, almost had to swim to it
K-Dot shit is only hittin' hard when Baby Keem put his pen to it
Ross callin' me the white boy and the shit kind of got a ring to it
'Cause all these rappers wavin' white flags while the whole fuckin' club sing to it
Murder scene on your man tonight, then come to the vigil with the candlelight
Body after fuckin' body and you know Rick readin' my Miranda rights
I'm goin' on vacation now, hope next time y'all plan it right
'Cause you gotta pay for sayin' my name, guess now niggas understand the price
Nigga, what? (

Ayy
Kendrick just opened his mouth, someone go hand him a Grammy right now
Where is your uncle at? 'Cause I wanna talk to the man of the house
West Coast niggas do fades, right? Come get this ass whoopin', I'm handin' 'em out
You wanna take up for Pharrell? Then come get his legacy out of my house
A cease and desist is for hoes, can't listen to lies that come out of your mouth
You called the Tupac estate and begged 'em to sue me and get that shit down
I'm losin' perspective on beef, Boi-1da send beat and I'll kill you for fun
Your daddy got robbed by Top, you Stunna and Wayne, like father, like son
Anthony set up the plays, Kojo be chargin' you double for nothin'
They shook about what I'ma say, but textin' your phone like, ""We already won""
You tell me what I shouldn't say, but fuck it, my nigga, it's already done
We already know it's a twenty-v-one, we already know why you went number one
It's clearly because of The Boy, the honorable thing is to give me the loot
You right about ""Fuck the big three,"" it's only Big D, and there's video proof
Our sons should go play at the park, two lightskin kids, that shit would be cute
Unless you don't want to be seen with anyone that isn't Blacker than you
We get it, we got it
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
We get that you like to put gin in your juice
We get that you think that you Bishop in 
Juice
When you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defense 'cause she bigger than you?
Your back is up against the curb, you diggin' for dirt, should be diggin' for proof
Why did you move to New York? Is it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?
Proposed in 2015, but don't wanna make her your actual wife
I'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?
'Cause we know the girls that you actually like
Your darkest secrets are comin' to light
It's all on your face like what happened to Mike
Oh shit, it's all makin' sense, maybe I'm Prince and you actually Mike
Michael was prayin' his features would change so people believe that he's actually white
Top would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites
And wait, you say your brother Jermaine, but you wanted him to stay out of the light
Oh shit, just follow me, right? 'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?
I get off the plane and nothing has changed, I head to Delilah with all of my ice
Head to Delilah with all of my ice, head to Delilah with all of my ice
This shit gotta be over by now for anyone out here that's calling it, right?
You're dead
You're dead, you're dead
There's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to hide, you know what I mean
They hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen
The picture you painted ain't what it seem, you're dead"
Drake,All Me,"September 24, 2013","I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (Yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, doggin' these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert, ill nigga alert""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If havin' a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me

Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of six
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next, but I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light-skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I'm blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to you
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do"
Drake,From Time,"September 24, 2013","What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause...

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here, eh?
Y'all need to know yourself"
Drake,The Motto,"November 15, 2011","I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter

Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO

Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One time, fuck one time
I'm callin' niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy, so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall, put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, doorknob
Talk stupid, off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer Bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue-kiss her other tongue
Skeet, skeet, skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, Tunechi

Now she want a photo, you already know, though (Yeah)
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO

Drake,Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2,"September 24, 2013","Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik

I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Yellow diamonds in my Jesús

Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle

Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us

My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel


Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg"

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker

The other night Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only twenty-seven and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Yeah, I'm good, you still working?
Tonight, right now?
Did I go out? Yeah, I went out, I went
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit
Wine or water?
Did you say something about a cold drink? I don't know
I'm delirious

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know he's not around, oh, oh
[Post-Chorus: Drake & 
Ericka Lee

Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flight's in the morning

And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just callin' 'cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in there mixed up
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry

Backstage in my city, it was friendzone
You won't ever take no chain off of us
How the fuck you big steppin' with a size-seven men's on?

Your last one bricked, you really not on shit
They make excuses for you 'cause they hate to see me lit
Pull your contract 'cause we gotta see the split
The way you doin' splits, bitch, your pants might rip
You better do that motherfuckin' show inside the bity
Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty
Then we need a verse for the Swifties

Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, aw, yeah

Yeah
Yeah
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah

Drake,Forever,"August 27, 2009","It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' 'ery girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, a—

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

Ayy, ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out and, goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, huh

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, a—

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, woah
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouths with a bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so, Drake

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me

I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Mama is a saint, yes, she raised me real good

Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?

Drake,Furthest Thing,"September 24, 2013","Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender

Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy

No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yeah, yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to"
Drake,Over My Dead Body,"November 15, 2011","How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry?""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

I think I killed everybody in the game last year
Man, fuck it, I was on, though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong, though
Shout out to all my niggas livin' tax-free
Nowadays, it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I'm just playin' the field, nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussin' my career again?
Askin' if I'll be goin' platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man, all of your flows bore me, paint dryin'
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearin' the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yeah
It's been that way from the beginnin'
I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin'
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

You say I'm old news, well, who the new star?
'Cause if I'm goin' anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over fed time
But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfuckin' funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feelin' good, livin' better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back pavin' the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinkin' at the Palms last night
And ended up losin' everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

Three in the morning, still going down"
Drake,Headlines,"August 9, 2011","I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know (Yeah)

I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything,"" money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake,"" girl, don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap-opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything,"" money on my mind
Mind, mind-mind
Tell 'em I apologize, it happened over time
Time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know (Yeah)"
Drake,Worst Behavior,"September 24, 2013","Worst—
Motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub Js with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'—nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause, man, it's a mission
Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?

On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us

Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior

Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B

Mothafuckers never loved us

Worst behavior

Who's hot, who not?
Tell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you, bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot 
Degrassi
 up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

Remember?
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Worst behavior"

Looking for revenge

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me, nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder, nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull

You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here?
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six, soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade

I don't know why they been lyin', but your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but, oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck

I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny
You don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl
She been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city
And that's word to Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell

Drake,Take Care,"November 15, 2011","I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (
I'll take, I'll take
)
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
[Chorus: Rihanna & 
Drake
]
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Yeah)

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost"

No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games

I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl

Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do"
Drake,THE HEART PART 6,"May 5, 2024","[Intro: Drake & 
Aretha Franklin
]
Now let me see ya prove it
Just let me see ya prove it
Alright

The Pulitzer Prize winner is definitely spiralin'
I got your fucking lines tapped, I swear that I'm dialed in
First, I was a rat, so where's the proof of the trial then?
Where's the paperwork or the cabinet it's filed in?
1090 Jake woulda took all the walls down
The streets woulda had me hidin' out in a small town
My Montreal connects stand up, not fall down
The ones that you're getting your stories from, they all clowns
I am a war general sеasoned in preparation
My jacket is covеred in medals, honor and decoration
You waited for this moment, overcome with the desperation
We plotted for a week, and then we fed you the information
A daughter that's eleven years old, I bet he takes it
We thought about givin' a fake name or a destination
But you so thirsty, you not concerned with investigation
Instead you in that Venice studio, it's a celebration
You gotta learn to fact-check things and be less impatient
Your fans are rejoicin' thinkin' this is my expiration
Even the picture you used, the jokes and the medication
The Maybach glove and the drug he uses for less inflation
Master manipulator, you bit on the speculation
You dumb and reactive, nigga, I'm petty with dedication
What about the bones we dug up in that excavation?
And why isn't Whitney denyin' all of the allegations?
Why is she followin' Dave Free and not Mr. Morale?
You haven't seen the kids in six months, the distance is wild
Dave leavin' heart emojis underneath pics of the child
Speakin' of anything with a child, let's get to that now
This Epstein angle was the shit I expected
TikTok videos you collected and dissected
Instead of bein' on some diss-direct shit
You rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit
My mom came over today, and I was like, ""Mother, I—
Mother, I—, mother—,"" ah, wait a second
That's that one record where you say you got molested
Aw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection
This about to get so depressin'
This is trauma from your own confessions
This when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected
That's why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it's so excessive
They actin' like it's so aggressive, but you just never known affection
I don't wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessin'
""Touch My Body"" by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin'
I never been with no one underage, but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with
Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respected
If I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested
I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested
But that's not the lesson, clearly, there's a deeper message
Deep cuts that never healed, and now they got infected
Like if Dave really fucked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin' resentment
I'm not sure how to ease the sentiment, this shit's too intimate
I'm praying you recover from both incidents
But you a piece of shit, so this shit really no coincidence
Drake is not a name that you gon' see on no sex offender list, Eazy-Duz-It
You mentionin' A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, ""Who was it?""
You thought you left D flat, D major
I'll slit your throat with the razor
And do Rick Ross Air like that one flight from Malaysia
I'm your baby mama's screen saver
Only fuckin' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager
I'm a fucking hitmaker, dog, not a peacemaker
Yeah, bullets that I'm stuffin' in each chamber, your ass in extreme danger
Stop buyin' views and bot comments, you may as well keep the paper
Shit you 'bout to need for later
I give a fuck about your streamin' data
You could drop a hundred more records, I'll see you later
Yeah, maybe when you meet your maker
I don't wanna fight with a woman beater, it feeds your nature
If you still bumpin' R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior
Said if they deleted his music, then your music is goin' too, a hypocrite
I don't understand why these people praise ya
Soundin' like you send him commissary when he need some paper
Album droppin' soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser 'stead of doin' hard labor
Nigga, I'll see you when I see you like Fantasia
And Whitney, you can hit me if you need a favor
And when I say I hit ya back, it's a lot safer
Huh, I promise

Yeah
I'm not gonna lie, this shit was some, some good exercise, like
It's good to get out, get the pen workin'
You would be a worthy competitor if I was really a predator
And you weren't fuckin' lying to every blogger and editor, but
It is what it is
You definitely got this shit burnt the fuck out though, like
You got ten more records to drop
The one before the last one, we finessed you into tellin' a story that doesn't even exist
And then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up
I would like that one, that w—, that-that would be some shit I could dance to if you wasn't
Triplin' down on some whole other bullshit, but
You know, at least your fans are gettin' some raps out of you
I'm happy I could motivate you
Bring you back to the game, like
You know, but
Just let me know when we're gettin' to the facts
Everything in my shit is facts (
Prove it
)
I'm waitin' on you to return the favor, like"
Drake,Shot for Me,"November 15, 2011","I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh, you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah, I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me
That's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always gettin' faded

Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me

Okay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says, ""I know you changed
I never see you 'cause you're always busy doin' things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewin' things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends tellin' you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr. Perfect
I could tell that you been cryin' all night, drinkin' all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me

Yeah
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And Heaven accept you"
Drake,Too Much,"September 24, 2013","Let’s try one more time
Cool

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one-hunnid
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin'
'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath
You're too worried about being the best out""

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess""
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
That's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together
We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down
Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
But we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Oh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, oh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh
(Don't do that—)

Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
'Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well, if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'"
Drake,Portland,"March 18, 2017","Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?

Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, ""How is niggas really gettin' down?""
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

Hell nah

No, I did not sign with Jay but I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade, buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay, me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play (Kid N' Play)
God, the way that she servin' that cake, I gotta sit back and digest (Straight up)

Drake,Look What You’ve Done,"November 15, 2011","Yeah
Yeah
Man

It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should've known
'Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've

It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've

Hi Aubrey
I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that
So God bless you
And I hope I'll see you"
Drake,Legend,"February 13, 2015","Yeah

I'm working on dying

I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check

You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know (That I know)
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho"

Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered (
Yeah

Stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was a angry yute while I was writin’ 
Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud, but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up, we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7 a.m. in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song, it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshiping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me, I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary
More Life"
Drake,Teenage Fever,"March 18, 2017","Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been 'cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind, so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love

Yeah, slightly, huh, took a left turn there
But very much 6 a.m.​
Slightly been awake for twenty-four hours
So please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam, I'm wafflin'
But man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ"
Drake,Crew Love,"July 30, 2012","Ooh, ooh
Woah, yeah
Ooh (Yeah)

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland

Why? 'Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew, woah

Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, ""Your lyrics do shit for me""
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Woah

Drake,U With Me?,"April 29, 2016","What these bitches want from a nigga?

On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you get at me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit"
Drake,Doing It Wrong,"November 15, 2011","When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, ""I love you too""

But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh

We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying

Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles

I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go

Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch

Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard 
Mr. Morale
A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now
You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you


Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee

Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay
Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay
I ain't thinkin' about no reaper, nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay
Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay
Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay
Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway
And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame
Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?
Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play
Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?
Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?
Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight
I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns
Then hop online like ""Pray for my city,"" he fakin' for likes and digital hugs
His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done
Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky
I'll park his son
The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way
I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted
What is it? The braids?
I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay
It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage
I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh
It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh
I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh

Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T
You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me
He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet
We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one
Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk


Remember?
Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?
Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch
I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous
Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
Surprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em
Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya
You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga
Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?
Ho, what? You ain't like that record?
""Back To Back,"" I like that record
I'ma get back to that, for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that
Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that
Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you
Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you
Am I battlin' ghost or AI?
Nigga feelin' like Joe Hale Osteen
Funny, he was in a film called 
A.I
And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him
I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin
Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America to imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie
I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie
Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas
I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm
Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food
Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too
If you take it there, I'm takin' it further
Psst, that's something you don't wanna do

Ooh
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
Stop"

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear, ""Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk""

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all, duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Wake yo' punk-ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga?)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the livin' room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons, but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""

G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, g-yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, g-yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, g-yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, g-yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, g-yeah, it's so real, g-yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

""Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch

I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived

If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

Understand, no throwin' rocks and hidin' hands, that's law
Don't be ashamed 'bout who you wit', that's how he treat your moms
Don't have a kid to hide a kid to hide again, be sure
Five percent will comprehend, but ninety-five is lost
Be proud of who you are, your strength come from within
Lotta superstars that's real, but your daddy ain't one of them
And you nothin' like him, you'll carry yourself as king
Can't understand me right now? Just play this when you eighteen

Dear Sandra
Your son got some habits, I hope you don't undermine them
Especially with all the girls that's hurt inside this climate
You a woman, so you know how it feels to be in alignment
With emotion, hopin' a man can see you and not be blinded
Dear Dennis, you gave birth to a master manipulator
Even using you to prove who he is is a huge favor
I think you should ask for more paper, and more paper
And more, uh, more paper
I'm blamin' you for all his gamblin' addictions
Psychopath intuition, the man that like to play victim
You raised a horrible fuckin' person, the nerve of you, Dennis
Sandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen, mm-mm
Your son's a sick man with sick thoughts; I think niggas like him should die
Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest they life
He hates Black women, hypersexualize 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish
Grew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better
He got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance
A child should never be compromised, and he keepin' his child around them
And we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'
Fuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose
I been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret
It's some weird shit goin' on, and some of these artists be here to police it
They be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home and callin' 'em tender
Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas
To any woman that be playin' his music, know that you're playin' your sister
Or better, you're sellin' your niece to the weirdos, not the good ones
Katt Williams said, ""Get you the truth,"" so I'ma get mines
The Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time
Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away
To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away
They lookin' at you too if you standin' by him, keep the family away
I'm lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe

Dear baby girl
I'm sorry that your father not active inside your world
He don't commit to much, but his music, yeah, that's for sure
He a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs
Try destroyin' families rather than taking care of his own
Should be teaching you time tables or watchin' 
Frozen
 with you
Or at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you
Instead, he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs, examples that you don't deserve
I wanna tell you that you're loved, you're brave, you're kind
You got a gift to change the world, and could change your father's mind
'Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusion
Money's always been illusion, but that's the life he's used to
His father prolly didn't claim him neither
History do repeats itself, sometimes it don't need a reason
But I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child
Give him grace, this the reason I made 
Mr. Morale
So our babies like you can cope later
Give you some confidence to go through somethin', it's hope later
I never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior
Sittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation
You need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain
I'll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rains
Yes, he's a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, right
And a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say ""more life""
Meet the Grahams

Dear Aubrey
I know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party
But truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body
This supposed to be a good exhibition within the game
But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name
Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?
Guess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you
And I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home
Thirty-seven, but you showin' up as a seven-year-old
You got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems
Bad with money, whorehouse
Solicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start
But I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom
I try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'
Crave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'
No dominance, let's recap moments when you didn't fit in
No secret handshakes with your friend
No culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin' your mother
Identity's on the fence, don't know which family will love ya
The skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas
Can't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman
You a body shamer, you gon' hide them baby mamas, ain't ya?
You embarrassed of 'em, that's not right, that ain't how mama raised us
Take that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements
Why believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in
'Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery
You lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury
You lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members
They all pussy, you lied on 'em, I know they all got you in 'em
You lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh
You lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come
You lied about the only artist that can offer you some help
Fuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself"

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes, I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it, but, today, I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibeBitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the colorblind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people 'round me just wanna be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only cosign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourself, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock, I'ma break out and then hide every lock

I can feel the changes

Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga
I'm mad (
He mad
), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

When you got the yams (
What's the yams?

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(
Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can
)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (
Oh no

I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (
A two-man cell

Something's in the water (

Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (
Oh yeah

The funk shall be within you

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence"
Kendrick Lamar,Poetic Justice,"October 22, 2012","Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

(
In the thundering rain
)
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, it's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

(In the thundering rain)
I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day, when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steerin'
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines

Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?

I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?

Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?"" Nigga
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy paintin' on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day, my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day, I sequel
If I got it, then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers"

Damn, I got bitches (Yeah), wifey, girlfriend, and mistress
All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower

I got twenty-five lighter on my dresser, yes, sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had, pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum, imposin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and

All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn, I got bitches, damn, I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend, and mistress
All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time

I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run that ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, ""K, you gon' marry mines""
Biatch, no way, biatch, no way
Biatch, no way, biatch, okay
I'm never livin' life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right on time
Biatch, go play, biatch, go play
Biatch, go play, biatch, I look like O.J.
Killin' everything from pussy to a motherfuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city mobbin' in the street, yellin'

All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn, I got bitches, damn, I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend, and mistress
All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower

Kendrick Lamar,"Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst","October 22, 2012","When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this mornin' and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothin' but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it 
Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I gotta fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, bullshit
And when I die, make sure my pussy tight...

When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh

Tired of runnin', uh, tired of huntin', uh
My own kind, but retirin' nothin', uh
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin', uh
Hands on the wheel, uh, who said we wasn't, uh
Dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst, uh?

Dope on the corner, uh, look at the coroner, uh
Daughter is dead, uh, mother is mournin' her, uh
Stray bullets, uh, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't, uh
Bring her back, uh, who got the footage, uh?
Channel 9, uh, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked, uh
Banana clip, split his banana pudding, uh
I'm like Tre, uh, that's Cuba Gooding, uh
I know I'm good at, uh
Dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst, uh

How many sins, uh? I'm runnin' out, uh
How many sins, uh? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce, uh
The reaper callin', uh, I'm cottonmouth, uh
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, uh, die with a coward, uh
Hope we get rich, uh, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder, uh
The same song, uh, a black flower, uh
I'll show you how to, uh

Dye your thirst, oh, dye your thirst, uh, dye your thirst, uh

What are we doin', uh? Who are we foolin', uh?
Hell is hot, uh, fire is proven, uh
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it, oh
Tired of runnin', uh, choirs is hummin', uh
Tell us to visit, uh, we lie about comin', uh
Now back to business, uh, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', uh, it's no discussion, uh
Hereditary, uh, all of my cousins, uh
Dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst, uh

Too many sins, uh, I'm runnin' out, uh
Somebody send me a well for the drought, uh
See all I know, uh, is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, uh
My best days, uh, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, uh, I stress days, uh
Say ""fuck the world"", uh, my sex slave, uh
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave, uh
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', uh, tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""

Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus' name, amen""

Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life, your real life"
Kendrick Lamar,The Blacker the Berry,"February 9, 2015","[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & 
Lalah Hathaway
]
Everything black, I don't want black (
They want us to bow
)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (
Down to our knees
)
Some white, somethin' black, I ain't mean black (
And pray to the God
)
I hate everything black (
We don't believe
)
Black, I want all things black
I don't need black, I want everything black
I don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, I own everything black

Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the Black, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this Black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the Black, go scream mother

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite"

Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

I've been dealin' with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and lettin' them annihilate me

Finna run into a buildin', lay my body—

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said, ""Think about what you saying, 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searchin'
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hole us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S, definition: royalty, king royalty, wait, listen
N-E-G-U-S, description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been usin' it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To Pimp a Butterfly

At first, I did love you

Late nights thinkin' of you

Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick

But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me

And you and you and you and me and—

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, 
I care

Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin’ with cold thumb
I’m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

Me, I wasn’t taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care,

Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, 
I care

Now

When I was twenty-seven, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated ten times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At twenty-seven, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
Thirty shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At twenty-seven years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of AmericaI love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom"

It's survival, survival
I think somebody lying
Smell somebody lying
I don't see no fire

Off-white Sunseeker at the marina
Fuck a Phantom, I like to buy yachts when I get the fever
Wine cooler spill on my white t-shirt, the sightseer
Trifecta, money, morals, and culture, that's my leisure
My visa, passport tatted, I show up in Ibiza
Lucalis dwellings in Brooklyn just to book me some pizza
Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom
God, ah, my confession is yours
But, who am I if I don't go to war?
There's opportunity when livin' with loss
I discover myself when I fall short
Raise my hands to a fallen sky, I fantasize
Me jumpin' planets immortalized, I correspond
Three angels watchin' me all the time
Put my children to sleep with a prayer, then close my eyes
Definition of peace
Tell me who gon' stop me? I come from love
Estelle cover my heart, then open me up
Remember when picked up a pen, lyrics that I can trust
Timid soul, stare in the mirror, askin' where I was from often
I know this type of power is gon' cost
But I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star
The mannerisms of Raphael, I can heal and give you art
But the industry's cooked as I pick the carcass apart

Yeah, somebody's lyin', I can see the vibes on Ak'
Even he lookin' compromised, let's peel the layers back
Ain't no brownie points for beating your chest, harassin' Ant
Fuckin' with good people make good people go to bat
Conspiracies about Cash, dog? That's not even the leak
Find the jewels like Kash Doll, I just need you to think
Are you finally ready to play have-you-ever? Let's see
Have you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me?
Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person
Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it
Can't Toosie Slide up outta this one, it's just gon' resurface
Every dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose
It was fun until you started to put money in the streets
Then lost money 'cause they came back with no receipts
I'm sorry that I live a boring life, I love peace
But war-ready if the world is ready to see you bleed
The Elohim, KTW, know you can't sleep, these images trouble you
Know the wires in your circle should puzzle you
If you were street-smart, then you woulda caught that your entourage is only to hustle you
A hundred niggas that you got on salary
And twenty of 'em want you as a casualty
And one of them is actually next to you
And two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle
Just don't got the audacity to tell you
But let me tell you some game 'cause I can see you, my lil' homie
You playin' dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya
You're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots
But your reality can't hide behind Wi-Fi
Your lil' memes is losin' steam, they figured you out
The forced opinions is not convincin', y'all need a new route
It's time that you look around on who's around you
Before you figure that you're not alone, ask: ""What Mike would do?"""

Woah, oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah (Ow)
Uh

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(One, two, one, two, one, two)
Uh, when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them twenty-five years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though y'all share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest? Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in? Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn? Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing; that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See, I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all
It's respect, but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed, then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson—oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga
[Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 
2Pac]
""I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusin' my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Goin' back and forth tryin' to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fightin' the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was 'respect'
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man
Maybe I'm just another nigga""
Shit, and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga,"" but it ain't really a poem
I just felt like it's somethin' you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa—, about a metaphor, actually
Uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that? What the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
 (Right)
That's how I see it, my word is bond
I see—, and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
 (Right)
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
 (Mhm)
And they gonna be so appetizing
 (Mhm)
You know what I'm sayin'? Wealthy
 (Right), 
appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor
 (Hungry), 
and hungry
Right
You know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be like—
You know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be—
There might—, there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu—, they might eat the rich, you know what I'm sayin'?
A'ight, so let me ask you this, then
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich, or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural-born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin', I took the opportunities
I worked at the m—, the most menial and degradin' job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
Uh, I went from havin' somebody managin' me to me hirin' the person that works my management company
 (Right)
I changed everything, I realized my destiny in a matter of five years, you know what I'm sayin'?
I made myself a millionaire
 (Right), 
I made—, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?
I made millions for the record companies
 (Mhm)
I made millions for these movie companies
 (Mhm)
Now I make millions for, for us (Mm)
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in ""all go—, all good things come to those that stay true""
 (Right)
You know what I'm sayin'?
And it was happenin' to me for a reason
You know what I'm sayin'? I was noticin'—, shit
I was punchin' the right buttons and it was happenin'
So, it's no problem, you know
I mean, it's a problem, but I'm not finna let them know
 (Hmm)
I'm finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a—, a fighter at heart, or somebody that, huh, somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh, threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance
And not only me, but it goes down my family tree
You know what I'm sayin'? it's in my veins to fight back
A'ight, well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
""We fightin' a war—, I'm fightin' a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down""?
In this country, a Black man only have like
Five years we can exhibit maximum strengthAnd that's right now, while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn thirty, it's like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a Black man in this country
And you don't wanna fight no more
And if you don't believe me, you can look around
You don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers (Mhm)
That's crazy, because me, being one of your offsprings of—, of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that there's nothin' but turmoil goin' on, so
I want to ask you, what you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed, for real
I don't think America know that
I think America think we was just playin' and it's gonna be some more playin', but it ain't gonna be no playin'
It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831
 (Mhm), 
up in this motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin'? It's go—, it's gonna happen (Mm)
That's crazy, man
In my opinion, the only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
A lot of people don't understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out, or where it comes from
Trip me out sometimes
Because it's spirits
We ain't even really rappin', we just lettin' our dead homies tell stories for us
 (Damn)
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It's actually something a good friend had wrote, describing my world
It says:
""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consumin' its environment, the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringin' back new concepts to this mad city
The result? Wings begin to emerge, breakin' the cycle of feelin' stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered
Endin' the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same""
What's your perspective on that?
'Pac? 'Pac? 'Pac?"

Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated

I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas? Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hundred-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure, you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you, I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it

I swear, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated

Loving you, loving you, not loving you, 100 proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

What I got to do to get to you?
To you, and—

And you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed,"" you ain't try

I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time that— I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk, it'll say, ""You gotta go""
And if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness"

Nothing but my children, one shot, they disappearin'
I'm in the city where the flag be gettin' thrown like it was pass interference
Padlock around the building
Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck just to play freeze tag
With a bone to pick like it was sea bass
So when I made it out, I made about 50K from a show
Tryna show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope
I'm prophetic, they only talk about it how I get it
Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics
How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?
Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out the plyometric
Nigga ran up out of luck soon as I upped the highest metric
The city just made it sweet, you could die, I bet it

Kendrick Lamar,DUCKWORTH.,"April 14, 2017","It was always me versus the world
Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
!
We gon' put it in reverse

Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
God is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing
They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

La noche de anoche
Y nos ponemos a llorar

Yesterday somebody whacked out my mural
That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe
But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure
The love and hate is definite without a cure
All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord
I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy
I done been through it all, what you endure?
It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural
Fuck everybody, that's on my body
My blick first, then God got me
I watch 'em pandеr with them back-handed compliments
Put thеy head on a Cuban link as a monument
I paid homage and I always mind my business
I made the—
I never lost who I am for a rap image
It's motivation if you wonder how I did it

Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank
Know you a god even when they say you ain't
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way
Never let no one put smut up on your name
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do
But understand everybody ain't gon' like you
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to
A couple rules of engagements, I'ma guide you

Que reflejan tu mirada
La noche, tú y yo

Ridin' in my GNX with Anita Baker in the tape deck, it's gon' be a sweet love
Fuck apologies, I wanna see y'all geeked up
Don't acknowledge me, then maybe we can say it's fair
Take it to the internet and I'ma take it there
Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it
Now I'm possessed by a spirit and they can't take it
Used to bump 
Tha Carter III
, I held my Rollie chain proud
Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down
Whatever, though, call me crazy, everybody questionable
Turn me to an eskimo, I drew the line and decimals
Snoop posted ""Taylor Made,"" I prayed it was the edibles
I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go
Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me
All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they showin' they faces
Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated
Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite
This is not for lyricists, I swear it's not the sentiments
Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit
Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids
Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons
Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous
Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends
Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman
I done lost plenty friends, sixteen to be specific
Put that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first
They like, ""Dot big trippin',"" I just want what I deserve
What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it's over with
I'm doin' what COVID did, they'll never get over it

Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank
Know you a god even when they say you ain't
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way
Never let no one put smut up on your name
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do
But understand everybody ain't gon' like you
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to
A couple rules of engagements, here to guide you

Niggas from my city couldn't entertain old boy
Promisin' bank transactions and even bitcoin
I'll never peace it up, that shit don't sit well with me
Before I take a truce, I'll take 'em to Hell with me
If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy
Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me
Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend
Y'all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did
Ain't no sympathy here, this shit's hilarious
It's a lot of opinions, but no power to carry it
2025, they still movin' on some scary shit
Tell 'em quit they job and pay the real niggas they severance
Don't insult my intelligence, I'm not just for the television
Teleport to Bullis Road and dig up all my relatives
Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal
Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die
Niggas cackling about— while all of y'all is on trial
Niggas thought that I was antisocial when I stayed inside of my house
You better off to have one woman, everything tricky right now
You niggas live in denial
Ayy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style
Exterminate 'em right now
Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud
No juice inside of my cup, I sober up and knock 'em all off
Don't let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that's law
I know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that's close to them
The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed, slide on both of them
You ever ate Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to pour water in it?
Pulled over by the law, you ridin' dirty, so you can't argue with 'em?
Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it?
Well, I did
Whacked the murals out, but it ain't no legends if my legend ends"
Kendrick Lamar,How Much a Dollar Cost,"March 15, 2015","How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more""
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need""
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga, you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God""

I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs"
Kendrick Lamar,The Art of Peer Pressure,"October 22, 2012","Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (
Woo
)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now


Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”

It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')

Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
(Police sirens)
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!"
Kendrick Lamar,These Walls,"October 13, 2015","I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk—
Sex
[Verse 1: Anna Wise & 
Kendrick Lamar
]
She just wanna close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (
Ah, come on
)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey, 
ah, girl
)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
 (
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
)
Oh, oh

These walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls tellin' me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in 'em just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before, they couldn't stand me
These walls wanna cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
 (
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
)
Oh, oh

These walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yellin' at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feelin' like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Lookin' at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
 (
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
)
Oh, oh


If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash 'em on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall tellin' you that commissary is low
Race wars happenin', no callin' CO
No callin' your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is tellin' me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hopin' the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls tellin' you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusin' my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently servin' life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room"

Travel round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin'
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin’
This seed in this soil is classified
I'm satisfied when I strategize my kid’s future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—

Don't tell a lie on me

Don't tell a lie on me

Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump

And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride

My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to Bible study faster?
Your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
In lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe

Heartache, she only doin' what she know
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure
If this world were—
If it was up to me
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything
I just wanna see you win, wanna see
If this world were 
mine

I can't lie
I trust you, I love you, I won't waste your time
I turn it off just so I can turn you on
I'ma make you say it loud
I'm not even trippin', I won't stress you out
I might even settle down for you, I'ma show you I'm a pro
I'ma take my time and turn it off
Just so I can turn you on, baby
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure

I know you're comin' for
Better days
If this world were mine"
Kendrick Lamar,Hood Politics,"March 15, 2015","K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil' hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
Fourteen years later, going hard like we used to
On the dead homies
On the dead homies

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
Our lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now, here, if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop
Flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes, 
""Sherm sticks, burn this""
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50-nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Co's, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

Fourteen years later, going hard like we used to
On the dead homies
On the dead homies

Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, ""The enemies done cliqued up""
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas' names on paper—you snitched all summer
Streets don't fail me now
They tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set-trippin' all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-icans
Red state versus a blue state—which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs, make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, ""What it do?""

Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
""K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box""
I box 'em all in, by a landslide
Nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said, ""It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game""

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one"
Kendrick Lamar,Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter,"October 22, 2012","Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of 
Martin
 go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Please leave your message for three-two-three
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
Eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
(Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear your ass
Matter fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on

Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right

Hello to the big stepper, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the sa—

Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make

Kendrick Lamar,Black Friday,"November 27, 2015","Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping 
College Dropout
, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Woah
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Woah
Burnin’ my leather-

I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved

I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know

The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep

Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em

Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap, then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice

What's up, my nigga?

Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick

Hello, Billy

So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby
I'm fuckin', I'm crazy

Kendrick Lamar,reincarnated,"November 22, 2024","Que reflejan tu mirada
La noche, tú y yo

I got this fire burnin' in me from within
Concentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin
Every day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain
Juggling the pros and cons of fame
I don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul
I recollect this isolation, I was four years old
Truth be told, I've been battling myself
Tryna navigate the real and fake
Cynical about the judgement day
I did past life regression last year and it fucked me up
Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus
Body after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947
My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him
I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing
Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level
The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel
And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world
With my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled
I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect
While the record business loved me
I was head of rhythm and blues
The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose
But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses
Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated

Another life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit
Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains
My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed
A musical genius what the articles emphasized
Had everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction
Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted
Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be
Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity
Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments
I needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin
Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar
Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'
My first assistant was a small town scholar
Never did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her
My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me
I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated

My present life is Kendrick Lamar
A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe
The only factor I respected was raisin' the bar
My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh
My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him
I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'
Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment
I close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious
I'm yelling, ""Father, did I finally get it right?"" Everything I did was selfless
I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them
I didn't gloat, even told 'em, ""No,"" when the vultures came
Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed
Son, you do well, but your heart is closed
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself
Father, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down
""But your pride has to die,"" okay, Father, show me how
Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for
I kept one hundred institutions paid
Okay, tell me more
I put one hundred hoods on one stage
Okay, tell me more
I'm tryna push peace in L.A. 
But you love war
No, I don't
Oh, yes, you do
Okay, then tell me the truth
Every individual is only a version of you
How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?
I could tell you where I'm going
I could tell you who you are
You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious
Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent
My greatest music director was you
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues
It was harmony and motion
I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken
Rehabilitation, not psychosis
But now we here now
Centuries you manipulated man with music
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving
You came a long way from garnishing evilish views
And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval
I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear
The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel
I'm using words for inspiration as an idea
So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?
I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding
For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now
You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity
And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy
Then let's rejoice where we at
I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated"

Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:

""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:

""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said

""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service"

Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled

It was my fault, not yours, not his, it was my fault, I'm sorry
You know
It was my fault

And I'm sorry I was young
But he's always wanted to be a father to you
So I, I fucked up and I take ownership of that
Of my choices and decisions
And I'm sorry for that
He's a good guy
So don't hold that against him, because it was my fault

And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us (Bitch)
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead, I rap about fucking bitches and gettin' heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby (Ah)
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhymin' pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours (Umbrella)
I hate this, screamin', ""Fuck patience""
Got a nigga shakin' like the calmest fucking Haitian (Ha-ha)

Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands (Bitch)
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's tryin' to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleadin' squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex Mix, she bleedin' from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirrin' ruckus, throwin' sets up, yeah (Wolf Gang)
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments

Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, ""Yeah, Bob, this nigga's sick""
Animal safari, if I offend you, I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead (Skinhead) since India Arie (India Arie)
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said ""Fuck coke"" and now I'm snortin' Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket (Casket)
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out, ""Fuck faggots""
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

What the fuck?
I, I'm speechless, that was—fuck
Shit, Tyler, you're- you're gonna need some help
I'm not a—fuck it, different subject
How's that girl you were tellin' me about?"

Him that ni-gga, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?

Nigga, who dem boys? (Who dem is?)
Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, ChristmasHe just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way güey, boy, that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone

They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Um
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
She thinks you're getting cash, no, bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait, turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig​ger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned
(I'm just fucking around)

Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty?
Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing (Uh)
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a Bimmer, E46
Have you heard ""48""? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do, I go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease, bitch!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down, I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare
On the same damn bus like, ""You're going to jail now""

Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty?
Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck? Bitch, suck dick
Motherfuck' you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can, sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I'm a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I'm badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!

How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well, if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm 'bout to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me
Tryna set mood, little RedTube, fuck lotion
I don't need lube, dry fist suits me (Yeah)
Up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound
The shit's kind of disgusting, fap time
And before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like—

"Tyler, The Creator",FUCKING YOUNG / PERFECT,"April 13, 2015","Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was somethin' special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck, I can't sing, whatever, look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana, but I had to pretend that I wasn't

There go the policeman, knockin' at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothin' more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because

'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fuckin' young (
For me, uh
)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (
No
)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fuckin' young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)

A six-year difference, uh
Is a ten year sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love

There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because

'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (
Woo!
)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fuckin' young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God, 
yo
)

When you're thirty-five, I'll be forty-one (
But you're too young
)
And when I'm twenty-seven, you'll be twenty-one, yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run (
But I know that you're the one
)
'Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo, this is dumb, you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself (
I know that you're too young
)
And mentally, you're older than me, and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help (
But I know that you're the one
)
So when you mention ""hang"", I'm thinking 'bout a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation- (
I know that you're too young
)
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention- (
But I know that you're the one
)
Span, it's gonna suck if shit hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off (
I know that you're too young
)
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught (
But I know that you're the one
)
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds, um
But I found my wings, fuck (
I know
)

But you're too fucking young
I really like you
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
I don't know what to do
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)
It won't even matter, I'll be in the clear, haha
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young, ha


Boy, I know that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy, I know that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I'll exit and wait a while
Just say the word, girl
Can't you see the answers are all there?
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you, girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all, baby, it's just you and me

But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin’ hurts
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah, haha

Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, 'cause I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, ""Fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, ""Hi,"" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the ""Tron Cat"" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (
Fucking faggot
)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (
Pistol, I got one!
)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(
Oh, shut the fuck up!
)
(Gunshot)

Samuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?"

Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas
Now back to the album
[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator (as 
Dr. TC)
]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and, um, I'm guessing 
that
Your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk
I mean, these sessions are going to go slow, so—

This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat
My father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple, but probably not, fuck 'em

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil that you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made ""Sarah"" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my head, it's telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught
Go to sleep

I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts he tell me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal
Play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or a fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No, bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother, I told her, but instead
I got a sister, just like me, with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations
Of the fucking situations that's having our brains racing's
Like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion, nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. 'cause I feel we're more talented
Than forty year old rappers talking 'bout Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve 'em
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'ma toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
'Cause my mothers let me do what I want, she wasn't careless
Protective, she is the bear, this shit is so bare
My diary isn't hid, my father didn't give a fuck
So it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have, so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I'm bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it

Woah, um
It seems you had a lot to say
And, uh, who knows? I might feel
As I'm evaluating—

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never, that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well, that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here, downing beers, simply just wishing
With a tear, they try to tell me, but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit, like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully, they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Wow, um
So, Tyler, if, uh
If you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?"

Don't say, ""Goodbye, smell you later"" (Later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah
Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend

(Friends)
Are we still friends? (This can't end)
Are we still friends? (I still wanna say hi)

We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well

Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I

Maybe, maybe (For you)
What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you

Kill yourself or anyone
You don't— you don't even have the balls to begin with
What you need is me, someone to talk to
Uh, it's been a while since our last session, so
Tell me what's been going on

I'm not a fucking role model (
I know this
)
I'm a nineteen year old fuckin' emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted tellin' people he's bumpin' all of my shit
These motherfuckers think I'm supposed to live up to somethin'? Shit
I'm still jackin' off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (
As you should
)
From Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked (Yeah)
Now competition missin' like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (That's not your fault)
But that's a whole fuckin' different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cookin'
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard
 intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual
Okay, you guys caught me
I'm not a fuckin' rapist or a serial killer, I lied
You know, you— you just want attention, you'll be fine
I try too hard, huh?
No, you don't

Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
'Cause I'm too fuckin' ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group (
Yeah
)
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve 'cause of you (
'Cause of you
)
(
Bastard was good though
) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make Parade
 or 
Inglorious
'Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fuckin' feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissin' waiver (Here)
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they feel the flavor

So um, ah, shit
Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothin', livin' out his dreams?
Why they gotta fuckin' hate?
I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature
Everyone loves you, Tyler, you have to believe that
I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fuckin' busy
I can barely kickflip now
Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at home?
What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doin'?
I have, I mean, you're a great person
I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?

People excited, thinkin' shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blastin' off? (No)
Fuck that, (That's gay) These niggas ain't fuckin' with me
'Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (
I love that shit
) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it (They don't, it's not made for them)
'Cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rappin', it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

It is, but Tyler, you're gonna have to cut down on that ""faggot"" word, that's very, that's a, that's a bad—
I'm not homophobic
I mean, I don't think you are, but—
Faggot
Alright, well, since the last time we—
The fuck is a good performance?
I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can
I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun
But your Twitter posts, just, I mean, they're really random and it's ADD
Who doesn't have ADD? Well, I don't
I mean, sometimes you just say really outlandish things
And we just wanna know, what's the problem for this?
I wish Thebe was here

Therapy's been sinnin' and niggas getting offended
They don't wanna fuck with me 'cause I do not fuck with religion (Why?)
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed 'cause some white kid had aimed (
What?
)
His AK-47 at forty-seven kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(I don't think anyone's going to men— I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you)
College wasn't workin' and I wasn't workin'
So I was at home jerkin' off until my dick was hurtin'
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
'Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you, you—)
Now I'm livin' dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother somethin' on her birthday
(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I, I—)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doin' pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doin' pretty good, I've seen that—)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fuckin' show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fuckin' life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playin' when I say I need counselin'
I sit in grandmother's livin' room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes, I just wanna die (No, you don't)

"Tyler, The Creator",Judge Judy,"October 28, 2024","I met this girl named Judy at the cafe 'round my way
Her breasts were near her chest and she had curls that hid her face
Her legs were Eiffel Tower, I could tell her daddy Black (Ah)
Peanut butter jelly toasted in her lap
We chop and chop it up, I like her thoughts and time had flew
She said she had no plans and ask me what I'm 'bout to do
I stuffed us in the Phantom and wiggled through the streets
She said she never do this, but she think that I'm sweet

So I won't judge Judy
No, I won't judge Judy

We end up at my home, we dance around and made some sweets (We made some sweets)
We started swapping spit and then she got on top of me (She got on top of me)
I ask her what she into, she told me lead the way (You go first, I'm into)
Body rubs, bondage, and creampies, we could play
Around in public, any cum is now a fetish, I imagine (Ayy)
Fiend for foot massages, giving oral is my passion (Uh)
You could ride my face, I don't want nothing in return (Wait)
Your body count and who you fuck is not my concern

'Cause I don't judge Judy (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
, what's your fetish and what are you into?)
No, I don't judge Judy (Don't matter, you're safe here, I won't judge you now)
No, I don't judge Judy (
Judy, Judy, Judy
, I, I'll try to hold you down and dick you down)
No, I don't judge Judy (
Judy, Judy

She's just like me, uh, yeah, uh, uh, yeah
I can't judge Judy (
Oh, na-na-na-na
)

She like rope, hands around her throat
Couple guys, it made her feel alive (
Yeah, yeah, oh
)
She had a free spirit, you know? (
Judy, Judy, Judy
)
And she was great with women, exhibitionist (Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy)
I lean voyeur, so it worked out (Judge Judy, oh my God)
Our frequencies matched (Oh, na-na-na-na)
No pressure, just, just
She wrote me a letter
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & 
Childish Gambino

Sorry that I haven't been communicating much (
Uh, ooh, ooh, ooh
)
This past year has been rough, it spreaded to my head (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
I knew it when we met, if you're reading, it's too late
I'm on the other side, but I just wanna say
Thank you for the moments I could grab before I left (Wait)
I hope you live your life, your truest self with no regrets
I wasn't living right until they told me what was left
I'm wishing you the best, P.S.
Thank you for not judging, Judy

And said ""Ayo! Can we get a pic?"" I said no
And they said ""Oh! It's Wolf Gang, ""Yonkers"", Goblin is my shit though""
Now I'm like, ""fuck, I don't want to be an asshole""
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Davon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear

They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, ""Hey, Tyler, can I...?""
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
""But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard ""Radicals,"" the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school, I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song ""Bastard"" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, ""Fuck, is he speaking to me?""
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (That's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (Uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (Alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (No homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to ""In Search Of..."" and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (Uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (What the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you, man (Alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like ""fuck""
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (What the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a ""hey"" (Sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play ""VCR""
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...""
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
""Yonkers"" and ""Yonkers"" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about ""Yonkers""
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
""Yeah, whatever, but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say ""Sagan Lockhart"" and when you came out to ""Sandwitches""
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started""

Just take this fucking picture man, shit..."

Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly, I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, it's so fucking exciting

We're making s'mores by the campfire

Sat by the fire

What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across from Bank of America?

My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day

My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was... my brother took me to my first concert ever, which was to Kanye West's ""Glow in the Dark Tour""
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different

""My November is right now""

I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love that I got for you has exceeded appearance
The lyrics are—
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point, I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't, I'll leave a voicemail with the playback

Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone"

I'm sick of hackin' and coughin', I'm often this fuckin' awesome
I'm animals, Noah's Arking, all from this rapping' nonsense
Four stories in my home like ""What the fuck's an apartment?"" (Nigga?)
Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty
And take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience

So I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss
You're talking too much, who the fuck are you to us? Uterus
I put that on my pubes and nuts if I don't begin moving up
I'm shooting up (Brrt!), you and her crew on turf, new desert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the whore on a bitch when she flocks around my crew to flirt
It's on ya shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse! I'm ill, I used this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to
Skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew
You can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view
Of visual, wools, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids after school, and give them drugs 'cause it's cool, fucker!

Shut 'em down!

That shit I need, be the shit that's green
A little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets
About three or four more than needed be
I got an eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape (Shit)
I hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes (Shit)
You could smell us in places when we walk and our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? (Uh...)
I think this Mary is laced, my heart is beating at paces
That Pacquiao can't relate, I'm fuckin' faded like gradients
Shit, I'm stuck like tape that's superglued
To the center of Kelly Price first waist
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm
Let's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit (Shut 'em down!)

C'mon, my nigga, you don't even smoke!
You weak as fuck, my nigga

Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so the fam’ can eat

Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want

The stories we coulda wrote if our egos didn't take the pen
Sorry to the freaks I led on (Nah, for real, I'm sorry)
Who thought their life was gonna change 'cause I gave 'em head on
But instead, I sped off, yeah, I know I'm dead wrong
Sorry to the guys I had to hide (Ooh)
Sorry to the girls I had to lie to
Who ain't need to know if I was by the lake switchin' tides, too (Tides)
Anyway, I don't wanna talk (Ooh)
Sorry if you gotta dig for info I don't wanna give
So you stalk, make up fibs, just to talk about my private life 'cause you're weird (Uh)
Met that girl this year (But), that's none ya biz
Give enough with my art, know your place
My personal space, y'all don't need to to be a part
I'm sorry I don't wanna link and small talk over dinner
I don't even drink, can't guilt trip me, I'm ice cold, roller rink
Nigga-nigga-nigga, read the room
Don't assume niggas is cool
Stay in your pocket, this is pool
Blah, blah, blah, blah 'bout trauma
You ain't special, everybody got problems, uh
Sorry I'm not empathetic (Nah, I'm fuckin')
Sorry you think I'm pathetic
Sorry I don't wanna bro down
Sorry I don't know your pronouns
I don't mean no disrespect
But, damn, we just met, calm the fuck down
Oh, I'm out of touch and I'm a jerk?
A bank account could never match my worth (That nigga gettin' money, he a dick now)
Sorry, Mother Earth
Polluted air with chemicals and dirt
These cars ain't gonna buy and drive themselves
What the hell you think I work for?
Not to not explore and stay the same (I'm)
Sorry to the fans who say I changed, 'cause I did
Sorry you don't know me on a personal level to pinpoint what it is
I'm sorry to my ancestors (I'm so sorry), I know I'm supposed to fight (I know)
But this ice shinin' brighter than a black man's plight, I'ma make it right
In the meantime, I'll give some advice while these blood diamonds gettin' cleaned off
Nigga, fuck the price, spend it then, then again, I can't save niggas
I'm not Superman, but I could try
I'm sorry I'm pretentious
Sorry that the talent, knowledge, passion isn't missin'
Sorry when I talk my shit and I could back it up with confidence, it get you niggas trippin', man
Fuck the numbers, fuck a hook
You put me on a stage and I'll show you the difference
Let me see y'all hit a stage (No, y'all can't do it)
Let me see y'all write a page (Y'all not gon' do it)
Let me see you make a decision I made
And claim that I don't know about minimum wage or Section 8
Water in the ketchup bottle to stretch when niggas ate
Gettin' pressed by niggas hoppin' gates
Thinkin' it's normal 'cause you ain't supposed to make it past eighteen or escape the Figure 8 cycle
And I promise this is like a diet, I'ma make a way and I did, did
Feel good, work paid off, now we gon' celebrate
But niggas claim you arrogant when they can't relate to moments of feelin' great
So they aim, duck-duck-duck 'em
Shot right back, buck-buck-buck 'em
Sorry, not sorry (Buck 'em, buck 'em)
I got two words, fuck 'em

Nas,N.Y. State of Mind,"April 19, 1994","Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
Yeah, it's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

Rappers: I monkey-flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes
Hand me a .9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at baseheads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers, ""Back up!""—the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, huh, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TECs
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha, and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black
I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dawg (You? What?)
Fuck Jay-Z
You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Fuck Jay-Z

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like a AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G.?
Ain't no best, east, west, north, south, flossed out
Greetings, I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne
I got this locked since '91 (Uh), I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly (Haha)

(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly

I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called 
Blueprint
 (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?

I will
Not lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh
The king is back
Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already

Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss"

Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons (
Yeah, yeah

The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescence street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin', we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

I woke up early on my born day; I'm twenty, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Hey yo D
Let's go all the way in on this one

Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out the gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord

Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience. That's what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer

Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze
And that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?

It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now

Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? What's man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless, I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn

This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World

I sip the Dom P, watchin' 
Gandhi
 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep

Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?

Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

Nas,The Message,"July 2, 1996","Fake thug, no love, you get the slug
CB4 Gusto, your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out
Montana way, the Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, 32 shotguns
Regulate with my thuns, 17 rocks gleam from one ring
Then let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on Millenniums
20G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets—the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique with the semi TEC, who want it?
Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock, I lace 'em
Fried, broiled with basil, taste 'em
Crack they legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from 
Last Dragon
? Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC, it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep, sunk in the seat, tinted, with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street, you was wildin', talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga gravy mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin' on my corner when it's pay-me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin, somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped, son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came, askin' me my name, what the fuck?
I got stitched up, it went through, left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop, so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin', all he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The 'Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme, it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war, niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together Uptown, coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes, and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back

Thug niggas
Yo, to them thug niggas gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
'96 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo

Bring the shit, man! Live, man!

Nas,It Ain’t Hard to Tell,"January 18, 1994","It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like 
The Shining
, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in 
Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell"
Nas,One Love,"October 25, 1994","Word is bond, you got six years on that jack, kid and shit is real
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
You gon' check shit out, man
Ayo god man, give me a cigarette
Yo here you go, here you go, here you go
Check it out, man, check out what I got here, man
What is that, what? What's that?
Yo it's a letter I got from my man Nas, man
Word is bond, yo yo
What it say, kid?

What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came, you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove (One what?) One love!

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York, the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets, I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V.I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home, I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies, though incarcerated, your mind dive
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for real-a
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin', ""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school textbooks, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend, hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with them corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the 'Bridge, we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said, ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre deuce""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was 'sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows, the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could have caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryna tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: Try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, shorty wop, one love

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
And to my man Goon, one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man Lake Luciano, one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big Bo, one love
(One love, one love, one love, one love)
To Oogie, yeah, one love
(One Love)"
Nas,If I Ruled the World (Imagine That),"June 4, 1996","Life
I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

Imagine smokin' weed in the street without cops harassin'
Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruisin' blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Troopin' outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin' fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holdin' dough, no parole, no rubbers
Goin raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time, watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon, Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', clique rollin'
Trickin' six-digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa, Africa

If I ruled the world (
Imagine that
)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand (hand)
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land (land)
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand (hand)
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land (land)

You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the Gat with the cocked hammer
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it
Sky's the limit, I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!

If I ruled the world (
Imagine that
)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled
I'd free all my sons (black diamonds)
(I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
(I love 'em, love 'em, baby)"

Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Ayo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up bless
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, buddha-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, god, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Barkim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent

One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York

To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Dime, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters

Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture, then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell... (Nas, Nas, Nas)

Before the Christ, After the Death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blastin' TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin' acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes givin' fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise — thug or die
Makin' choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is

I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always got you, I'm like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer, man
I'm like bein' locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feelin' of a millionaire spendin' a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down, and I watch it blow up

Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights and blight crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strapped
With my peeps that's into drug money market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya

One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis — is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin' — some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say, ""Peace""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real, watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' out of Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' out of Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' out of Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' out of Queensbridge

Comin' outta-a-a-outta-a-a-outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Comin' outta-a-a-outta-a-a-outta Queensbridge

Nas,Halftime,"October 13, 1992","(Right... Right...)
Check me out, y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'ma ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) A-yo, it's halftime
(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise 'cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime

(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out

(Right...) It's still halftime
(Right...) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right...) '92, it's halftime
(Right...) Yo, police, police man, yo, let's get ghost
Halftime..."
Nas,Affirmative Action,"July 2, 1996","This is what.. this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about, word
Time to take affirmative action, son
They just don't understand, you know what I mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
You know what I mean?
Niggas don't understand the four devils:
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact, sip your Cognac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler!
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone, or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats politickin' daily wit' diplomats
See, me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch wit' his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out!
Yo! The smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your C.R.E.A.M. go between us
Real shit! My Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega — the pretty boy with Mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!

Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like 
Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that ""Somebody gotta die"" shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so Hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabees be the apparel through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In a Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E-Moneybags got Moët Chandon, bundle of 62
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a phat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby! From BK to the 'Bridge
My nigga Wiz, Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods — they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke, nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla, we gotta flee to Panama
But wait — it's half-and-half, ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16, double it, times 3
We got 48, which mean a whole lot of C.R.E.A.M
Divide the profit by 4, subtract it by 8, we back to 16
Now add the other 2 that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki, then that's more for me
Mad coke and mad leak plus a 500, cut in half is 250
Now triple that — times 3, we got three quarters of another ki

The Firm, baby, Vol. 1, uh!"
Nas,One Mic,"December 18, 2001","One time
Yeah, yeah

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with nines out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now

Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (That's all I need)
All I need is one mic (All I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (Yeah)

All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now

All I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)
All I need is one mic (This is all I need)

All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

All I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (Fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (To spread my voice to the whole world, baby)"
Nas,I Can,"December 13, 2002","I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun, 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV, like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful – some men be
Rapists – so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so?
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know?
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men, and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – be–fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from Black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money, it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander The Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with Black faces
Shot up they nose, to impose, what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive, until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king!
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, 
""She's my Queeeeeen!""

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo, I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease

On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'?
I be tryin' to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool to ask?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I'd gallivant around the Equator, if that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris' with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of ""Me & My Bitch"" by Biggie

I call it, yeah, yeah

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters

I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls, uh

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

Nas,Made Nas Proud (Let Nas Down Remix),"June 22, 2013","Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, as far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is hauntin'
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn
She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggas, weak flow, yo, Cole, let's murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
'Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
But I passed them niggas, just bein' nasty, nigga
Military hat, fatigue pants saggin', Henny'd up
Execs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor, Arm and Hammer
But I had appeal, I was a charmer
Yet still bein' my mama's son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was gettin' mad
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warnin'
Global warmin' to that cold world you was breathin'
That's some advice I never got
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock
While you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you
That if you say what's on ya mind, you can stand the test of time
Now I'm playin' 
Born Sinner
 loud, saw you live, rock the crowd
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud

So you ain't let Nas down
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga
You ain't let Nas down
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin', nigga
You ain't let Nas down

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals

Do it now
Weak, jealous motherfuckers!
Do it now, do it now!

Don't hate me, hate the money I see (
Yeah
), clothes that I buy (
Uh-huh
)
Ice that I wear, flows that I try (
C'mon
)
Close your eyes (
That's right
), picture me rollin' sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that's swollen, the riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed, Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater (
You the best, that's right
)
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters (Haha)
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper (Watch this)
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence, for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gate dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens (Hah, picture that)
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate? Be my guest, I suggest –

Money is power, motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary!
Do it now!

You can hate me now (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (C'mon) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (C'mon)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now

Do it now! (I told you, do it now!)
Let's go

You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""Nas a clever nigga, nothin' to play with""
Hate on me, I blew, but I'm the same OG
People warned me: ""When you on top, there's envy""
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood, but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the street, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too! (Do it now!)

You can hate me now (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (Now) (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Do it now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (C'mon) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (Uh) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Uh, uh)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now (Do it now)

I like this, I like the way this feels (Let's go)

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows (
Yeah
)
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one (Right)
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board, until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause, my driver, niggas shot up my doors (That's right)
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks (
You tried?
)
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' 'em up (That's what you get)
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the Theory Of Man
Became a monster, atop of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin' – c'mon!

(Yeah) (It won't stop)
You will never seen a nigga like me (It won't stop) ever in your life (You can hate me) (Never!)
And that's what you can't understand!

You can hate me now (C'mon) (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Do it now, do it now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (Do it now, do it now, niggas) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (C'mon) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Hate me now)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now) (Hate me now)
You can hate me now (C'mon, niggas!) (You can hate me now)

You can hate me now (C'mon, niggas!) (You can hate me now)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)
(But I won't stop now)
It ain't gon' never stop, niggas! (I can't stop... I can't stop...)"

Bucket on low like Erick and Parrish
Closed casket flow, all you niggas get deaded
They don't give you one single rose while you can smell it
So I pick from my own garden (Garden)
Wanna go out in my garden like Godfather
Grandkids and a Rottweiler got over the block trauma (Yeah, trauma)
So what you sayin', nigga? You gots to chill (
Uh-huh

Thinkin' you the truth, really you not for real (EPMD!)
Back to back with it, the hardest shit of the year (Nasir Jones, remix)

EPMD, we back in business
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us, come to your senses (Uh)
P is the second comin' of God, somеthin' to witness
Piece of shit, fly on your hеad like Mike Pence's, we in the trenches
I'm mad, better yet, I'm on a rampage
My people can't even get minimum wage
Fuck a stimulus (Uh), give me some interest (Uh)
Give me a loan (Oh), give me a home
Give me that land you owe me so I can roam
So when you trespass, blaow, one in your dome
Best wishes, ghost 'em like he Tommy
Ain't worried 'bout nothing 'cause Hit Squad behind me

EPMD, we back in business
I visualize what it is, not what it isn't
We at the mafia table next to the kitchen
Eatin' Michelin Stars, countin' a million

Dun! I let it go for the family, meetin's at Cote in Miami
Them wine bottles on maggie, extra large
Sign up for my masterclass, Escobar
Feet up at Mets Stadium at my restaurant
Tied in from AZ to Dave East
You know my thoughts get crazy
My teachers, they couldn't grade me
I know some Haitians in Dade County, got choppers in Haiti
She booked a flight to Colombia, made her body amazin'
Just to post it on Tumblr, this that ""fuck up the summer"" shit
I don't care what you comin' with, me and Hit-Boy runnin' shit (Runnin' shit)
Big gold, rope chains, but they flooded now (Yeah, flooded now)
Pull up with the Ghost like a haunted house (Haunted house)
She gettin' scary, blood on my hands like Carrie
Might walk through a cemetery to see where hip-hop is buried
I said it was dead, but it faked its death like Machiavelli
You see letters in red splatter, look like sauce and spaghetti
(Yeah, ready?)

EPMD, we're back in business (What?)
Livin' in cramped conditions, will give you ammunition
I stock those shelves, I got those shells like Taco Bell and I'm not gon' fail
I got no L's (Noels) like Christmas, you don't wanna make the claws (Claus) come out (Nah)
Y'all should call yourselves Santa (Why?) 'cause none of y'all are real (Nah)
Not a 'single one' (Like what?), like a dollar bill (Yeah)
Just like your bitch in appellate court, she's on a pill (Appeal)
We got her a 'bond' and she'll
Never 'bail' on me (Bail on me), not even outta jail (Haha, jail)
EPMD, but me, I gots no chill (Ch-chill)
Just a lotta skrill
Lady, my paper's so crazy, I just tossed a mil' out the window of my mobile
On the fuckin' freeway on the way here (Yeah)
Like Rudolph and his homies when they pullin' the sleigh, yeah
That's a lot of bucks flyin' when I'm makin' it rain, dear
Green on me but no weed, shorty, just these, darling
A pocket full of pills, some are Tylenol 3s, prolly two or three Molly
So some are E  (Summary), which reminds me of ""Rap Summary,"" mami
My theme song, me and ""P"" always used to play that shit on repeat all day
So please call me ""Big Daddy"" (Daddy)
Plus I got the Kane (Cane) and ""Lean On Me"" (Yeah)
MCs, I'm eatin' you B-I-T-C-H's like tortilla chips
Me, I'm free of debt, yeah, green is on Chia Pet (Woo)
This is the effects of my old neighborhood misery index
Poverty at its peak, OCD and PTSD, I guess
R.I.P. out to DMX, Stezo E and Nipsey
Ecstasy and Prince Markie Dee, MF DOOM, I hit 50 via text
Told him that I love him 'cause I don't even know when I'ma see him next (Nah)
Tomorrow could be your death (Bring that beat back)
Yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
'Cause the brain's illa trained killer, danger, deranged
And I drank all the DayQuil (Yeah) I blank on the paper
Then wait 'til the page fill up (What?)
Hate spiller, shameful the strength of a pain pill or tranq'
I just pray for the day when I'm able to say that I'm placed with the greats
And my name's with the Kane's and the Wayne's, and the Jay's and the Dre's
And the Ye's, and the Drake's and the J Dilla's, Jada's, Cool J's
And the Ra's and amazin' as Nas is, and praise to the Gods of this

For all y'all enjoyment – a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldiers, survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly, and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe, so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless – say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem – put your hand up that you shoot with
Count your loot with, push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack where you and your mens at
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop, like we bringin' '88 back

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas – lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers, and killers can move swift
Girls, get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?

I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight ya punk asses
Like Pun said, ""You ain’t even en mi clase""
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV, plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

And I like a little sassiness, a lot of class

I'm a leader at last – this a don you with
My 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness"

And you're sitting at home doing this shit
I should be earning a medal for this
Stop fuckin' around and be a man
There ain't nothin' out here for you
Oh yes, there is… This


Yo, Nas, yo, what the fuck is this bullshit on the radio, son?

Chill, chill! That's the shit, God, chill

True indeed, knamsayin'?
But when it's real you doin' this
Even without a record contract, knamsayin'?

Ayo, Nas (
What up, pah?

When I'm chillin', I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and rootin' for the villain, huh
Plus, every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After bein' blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, lifestyle protection
Pickin' up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck — rockin' the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well, acappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, hops, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten, I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rockin' microphones and twistin' off a 40 top, yeah

One time for your mind, one time (
Yeah, whatever

One time 4 your mind, one time (

What up, niggas? How y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writin' rhymes, but besides that, I'm chillin'
I'm tryin' to get this money, God — you know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starvin' make you wanna do crimes, kid
But I'ma lamp 'cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catchin' 3-to-9's, Muslims yellin' ""Free the mind!""
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid, when I would say that outta town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind, plus control a .9
Fine, see, now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floatin' like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write, my hand is hot
And expand the lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pah
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic, and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11 and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in Heaven

One time for your mind, one time (
It sounds clever

One time for your mind, one time (
Yeah, whatever

One time for your mind, one time
Yo, from '92 to '99

Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, ""I thought you would protect me from this scary place?""
""Why'd you let them inject me?""
""Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?""
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso

Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny

Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me

My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children, I made a killin'
I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are?
I need evaluations, I'm savvy, y'all
Eatin' foie gras and caviar, listen

Adam and Eve don't fall too far from the apple tree
Ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothing less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write
Bursts light, brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or
The spa, spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under their belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existing, existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah

Adam and Eve don't fall too far from the apple tree
Ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit, no bacon
Brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin', say something
You stay frontin' but these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is there less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni go hard
A red Bordeaux, oh God

Adam and Eve don't fall too far from the apple tree
Ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree"
Nas,Take It in Blood,"July 2, 1996","I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

Yo, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest, prestigious Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex, watchin' 
Kathie Lee & Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezin' executioner
Winter time, I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxin', my bitches, they be laughin'
They high from sniffin' coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin', Sergio Tacchini
Flippin' mad pies, low price, I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the 'Do or Die' slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty gods poppin' wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip-hop's got me on some ol' sprayin' shots like a drum roll
Blankin' out, never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite I separate, watchin' crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holdin' government names from Ness
MCs are crawlin' out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

Currency is made in the trust of the Messiah
I'm spendin' it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singin' 
Reasons
 why I'm
Up early, trustworthy as a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remy on imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I, dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be buggin' out — new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin' niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma in a sentence
Paragraphs indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon roof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo, the system wants the coon's noose — hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement like I'm facin' twenty-years in the basement
Chillin' on a VI with Mumia
For wearin' chrome, I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
But like Capone, I'm thrown, yo

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

Yo, the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin', court pen pacin'
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We livin' in, dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the Real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin' boy
Coke suppliers actin' biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's
Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer, MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler, demi
Bottles of Mo', yo, simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and butt-holes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed toward the peasy-haired brick housing
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transportin' thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin' to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped
Watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catchin' mad feelings
Peelin' off in a Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed

Nas,I Gave You Power,"July 2, 1996","Damn, look how muh'fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun, I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong, so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel, for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats, they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches, four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out, I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves, under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

Always, I'm in some shit!
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear
Stunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years, I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five-and-zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a 9
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf, his eyes bubbling
He said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger, but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of them thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'!
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!"
Nas,Bye Baby,"July 17, 2012","I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happened when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming
""Hate you so much right now""
Should've saw the meaning, angry black women
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet, the cuter version, yet, I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself, and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, we got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!""
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, then later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life, of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby guess what...

I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) Forever
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby

Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition?
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was suckers, cowards
Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?""
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even a lie
At least I can say I tried, plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again, it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby

Gimme the key back, baby
I want your love back, baby, oh
Gimme the key back, baby, oh
'Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye
Goodbye"

Uh.. uh.. uh

New York streets, where killers'll walk, like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide, on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died; one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you""
I was a teen, drunk off brew
Stumbled, I wondered if God sent him 'cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah, man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin' their little cooch
Gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's, double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch 'em
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool, but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A
See a dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered, and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight, they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him ""I ain't fuckin' with you""
He responded, ""Cool,"" but told me ""Out here, this how motherfuckers—""

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?

Street dreams are made of these

Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes

Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from bein' rich

A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smokin' on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her

Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out

""I wrote my way out""

When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, th'was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and ""I wrote my way—"" out

I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political power—just lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens
The definition of what 
It Was Written
 means
Know what I mean?

(
""I wrote my way out""
)
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and ""I wrote my way—"" out

I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was a sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trip to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

(
""I wrote my way out""
)
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out!

High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin';
""Oh, you think you smart?""—Blaow!—start bleedin'
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, ""Pssh—you'll get 'em right back.""
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
""Damn, you got no chill,"" fuckin' right—I'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out?

(
""I wrote my way out""
)
Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)
'Cause ""I wrote my way—"" out!

""—picked up the pen like Hamilton""
""I wrote my way out of the pro—""
""—wrote—""
""—wrote my way out of the projects""
""—pick—""
""—picked up the pen like Hamilton""
""I wrote my way out of the—""

""—picked up the pen like Hamilton""
""I wrote my way out of the pro—""
""—wrote—""
""—wrote my way out of the projects""
(""I wrote my way out"")

""Really, I saw, like, a hole in the rap game, so, if I wanted to put my little two cents in the game, then it would be from a different perspective.""

""I thought that I would represent for my neighborhood and tell their story, be their voice, in a way that nobody has done it. Tell the real story."""
Nas,Got Ur Self a Gun,"December 4, 2001","Woke up this mornin' (
Yeah
)
You got yourself a gun (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Got yourself a gun

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines, so
I got mine, I hope you 
got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you 
got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in 
Belly
 with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames could huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody

I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun, yo

I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed, hair parted with a
Barber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life, it's
Return of the golden child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu's, tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me God's Son with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

It's the return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss
Stick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (Uh)

I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

Got yourself a gun (Uh)
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun"
Nas,Cops Shot the Kid,"June 15, 2018","The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
""Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!""
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, ""Ree, put your hands up, black boy!""

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid

I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense
Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (
Workin' nine-to-five

The cops shot the kid

Nas,Nasty,"August 9, 2011","[Intro: Nas & 
Big Kap
]
(Y'all ready for Nas?
Queensbridge, y'all ready to see Nasty Nas?
Uh huh, they ready)
Yeah, word
Got some Rémy Martin
And some good-ass cigars, check it out

Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince 'em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD

Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage, I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege
Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me, I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Montana from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black, light another blunt in fact, haha...

(Nasty) Nasty kid
(Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) The kid! (Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) Nasty kid (Nasty)

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin' saying, ""It was Nas I used to hustle with""
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
Guns on my waist, past this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my team, nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I'm no fake rap CD listener
Sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga"
Nas,Last Real Nigga Alive,"December 13, 2002","Uhh... uhh, uhh...

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice, like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive–that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice, like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through (Uhh)
I'm the last real nigga alive–that's official

Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought ""Kick in the Door"" was for?
But that's my heart
Y'all still trippin' off the Jigga shit
Real niggas, listen up, and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top, I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at The Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin' out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin' new rules
So I got in them shoes – tried 'em, wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit, so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warrin'
I wrote it in my album –
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changin', I had a baby
I was makin' my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticin' my flow, and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in, with more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new ""Thang""
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before 
'Ready To Die'
 hit
Big and I hit blunts, performin' at the Ark
Next thing you knew – Big blew and all the ballin' starts
He had Kim in his crew, I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon
My niggas – but dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on 
The Purple Tape
""Bad Boy bitin' Nas album cover"" – wait!
Big told me Rae was stealin' my slang
And Rae told me, out in Shaolin, Big would do the same thing
But, I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with ""Ain't No Nigga""s
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg; the rappers
Today, don't know nothin' about this boss shit
There's more shit to wantin' to be this King of New York shit
Uhh, uhh, uhh...

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice, like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive–that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice, like a Ginsu (Uhh)
Look at the life that I've been through (Yeah)
I'm the last real nigga alive–that's official

Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest in peace, Will – Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute
At some point, 'til I got to know him
We old friends – but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve
And Steve thought the drama's on me
'Cause previously it would've been–against whoever, friends forever
However–I learned, with some niggas, it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then, this nigga's with Jigga too much
He used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man, who used to be alone, plannin'
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets – later on, she hittin' the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinkin' he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine, yo
But that's her – I ain't mad, baby
It made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
'Illmatic'
 – I was boss, 
'It Was Written'
 – I flossed
One of the most creative LP's ever to hit stores
In 
The Firm
 I learned 
'I Am...'
 
'Nastradamus'
'QB's Finest'
, ""Oochie Wally,"" faced more problems
I gave it all up, so I could chill at home with Mama
She was gettin' old and sick, so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not 'til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character, degrade my hood
'Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules, I understood
What y'all want, see, I already had
'The Gift and The Curse'
?
Fuck that shit – the first shall be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D, S-O-N – they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him, and his whole squad for dolo...
Uhh, uhh, uhh...

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice, like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive–that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice, like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive–that's official"

Shout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Bimmer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with

Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait, do I got love for you?
I might kill you but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame 'cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of their failures
Through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to

Looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up
I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go, man
Let's go

When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue, do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
Only the strong will continue, I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

Hey, the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self-defeat is your own dispute
And man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
Play a star and you know your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right
And know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail
And the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Outrun all the sprinters on Mount Olympus
My God's tougher than Zeus

When the Armageddon's dark and dread (Uh, I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan (Uh, uh, I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue, do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah), I know you have it in you (Yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you

Uh, as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
New York to Cali, for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind
'Cause in life, you cannot press rewind
Get it right, you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputation supersedes itself
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?
And disregard those who most need your help
Thick skin, the dark won't take my soul
Survive spiritual wars, see my welts
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clench my fists, ready to go against whoever
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end

When the armageddon's dark and dread (Uh, I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan (Uh, uh, I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue, do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and tread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (Yeah), I know you have it in you (Yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you

Huh, no man live forever, but never say never
Every good, he want better, must be a go-getter
And always be clever in every endeavor
'Cause drastic time call for drastic measure
Yuh birthright to pleasure From yuh navel string sever
The land and the treasure, work for whatever
Jah said don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
The immortal stepper
Believe in every skin no matter which color they are
We never let we don't know here which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebecca, don't stop for a second
Everyone reckon, it sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in

When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue, do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and  moan
Only the strong will continue, I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

I'm a street lifer, always harrassed by the cee cyphers
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe
I emerged from the street life
This for the homies who relate, know what it be like
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis XIII life
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life
Cursed with his son Brandon
If that's you and me, Knight, I pray our fates greater
I speak life, I still matter as a rapper, no doubtin'
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Kallman
How in, the hell am I supposed stay comfy
When I pay child support, alimony monthly?
Got Maseratis and Ferraris
Only like a woman who's a rider, but only ho's want me
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me
I say ""Stay faithful,"" they say their man corny
So I'm, stuck with a married woman, so fine
Cheatin while they husband rushing on the 40-yard line
Wonder if this is what my ex did the whole time
Good niggas seem to always end up with some hard times, hope not
If a pimp slippin and a ho plot
Ain't nothin to a G in a two-tone drop, kid
And it don't stop, see a nigga dissapearin'
With the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeah"

Embarrassed but managed to get a plate...
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting home late...
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like ""Mister, spare-a-quarter""
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Fifteen, I got a gun
Sixteen, I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them though, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

""Say YEAH!
Haha, thank ya!
Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!""

I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies, they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted, G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

""Say YEAH!
Haha, thank ya!
Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!""

1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread 'em, hit 'em and dead 'em
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis, this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha

""Say YEAH!
Haha, thank ya!
Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!"""
Nas,Hip Hop Is Dead,"November 5, 2006","[Intro: will.i.am & (
Nas

Hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
(
Had to flip this track again, y'all!
)
Hip, hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
Hip, hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip, hip hop is dead (
NYC! Dirty South!
)
Hip, hip hop (
West Coast!
)
Hip hop (
Midwest!
)
Hip hop (Let's go!)

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(
Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead
)

Yeah, people smoke, chill, party, and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise, with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, ""Nas helped grow us up""
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million in billin', I helped blow them up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So, like my girl Foxy, the kid went Def
So, people, who's your top 10?
Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(
Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead
)

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Come through, something ill, missing the ceiling
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that – why's that?
'Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crack
'Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half-listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
""Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee""
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(
Hip hop just died this morning
Hip hop just died this morning
Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead
)

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper, since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
R.I.P. – we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From Beat Street to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacob's
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut"
Nas,Purple,"September 23, 2002","Light it, uhh
Light it up, uhh

The whole city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it
It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it, or dump it
Write it across the stomach, spell ""God's Son""
Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' their place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple

Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah... light it up
Light it up, uh

Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who've got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind their shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground, but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you, even now, that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back, they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate – think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead, they tell 'em how to reach through the bars–holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tier in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor, and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple"
Nas,You’re Da Man,"December 18, 2001","Uh, uh
Yo

They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas too real, Nas, true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I ever make a record, I'll take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with cracks in my sock, 'sleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets
But look at me now

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man

Yo, ugh, look, look, ugh, that's that bitch Wiz was fuckin' (Haha)
Damn, that's fucked up
Nigga, let's get high, nigga (Roll them dice, nigga, hurry up)
Highest to the sky, it's four hundred in here, nigga
What the fuck is you niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
One, one, one, all around the bar
Come on, let's get high, nigga, oh, shit, oh (Oh)
Four fifty-six, nigga, shut the fuck up
Fuck y'all niggas, run my fuckin' money (Run that back)
Run that back, man (Bust it back)
I gotta get high, man, you got weed? (Run that back)
Run it back? Alright, run it back, c'mon"

And the years them carry on and I miss you even more
Still I send them go to school and tell them
What dem fi know
All of mi friend dem mi salute, Daddi gon Lenny Screw
Another year has come and past, man a drop like morning dew
Uncle Warrick sick and gone when him couldn't catch a flu
Picka T you a mi don, respect long and overdue
When nothing never did a gwan you still have on somethin' new
Our friendship ever last all when one minus from few
Yes we surely had a blast, we're like family, me and you
A nuh every path you cross lead to somebody whe true
Of the many that are called only chosen is a few

Of the real friends that serve you long

Your real friends will serve you long
Sunshine or rain
Your real friends will serve you long
Acquaintances will fade
Your real friends won't do you wrong
Real friend don't change

Only talking with winners, a loser or two got my number
Still they think they real but they just really awfully bitter
Salty niggas hate the smarter ones, these are the doubters
Who sour 'bout my run, I barely made it out the slums
My value high 'cause I do more than rap about a gun
I made money for niggas, y'all never looking out for none
I helped millionaires get to that very position
Some real millionaires. See, that's ill, 'cause look at statistics
Real millionaires and I ain't talking ghetto riches, thorough business
You mistreating niggas, heard your folks bleed in prison
You ain't a G and if you was I don't recall
Who would roll with y'all, bunch of fucking know-it-alls who's dough is small
Look what's it come to our rapport's good no more
We was good before till I saw what type a dude you took me for
We had a chance to take paper down, what I took was more
Because of hatred, opportunity wasted

Your real friends will serve you long
Your car and clothes will fade
Your real friend won't do you wrong
Real friend don't change, hey

Your real friend won't run in war nuh care what the cost is
You real friends are in for all the wins and the losses
Fi Real! No question at all them ready fi rise the tallest
Take to the enemies all for one and one for all this
Real friend will hear you out, no secret feelings
Real friends won't sell you out, no bargain pleading
For real, always looking out a meal
When outside a drought your real friend won't hide you out, no

Your real friends will serve you long
When all else fails
Your real friend won't do you wrong
Real friend don't change

May laughter from backstabbers turn to tears faster
I wish for you no snake shall slither past ya you have to
Keep your vision clear cause only a coward lives in fear
My surroundings got only real powerful niggas here
Real men we have a code of ethics, no question
No jealousies, no feminine tendencies, we expecting
No gossip, no phony logic, no counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense for legal defense if your homey locked up
No keeping tabs on who was the last who looked out
Selfishness that's a character flaw, no holding out
Yo, what happened to the honor? You're dealing with sensitive Primadonna drama
Teflon love for my dudes who solid

Your real friends will serve you long
Your memories might fade
Your real friends will serve you long
Sunshine or rain, eh
Your real friends will serve you long, woe ya woe
When all else fails
Your real friends won't do you wrong
Real friend don't change

Or scantily

Or emptily
With arm in arms
We'll all trod on
Through destiny

Should I be down
Or even out

Ayo, it's poison
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison

In hospitals, shots riddle the block
Little children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' ""Rest In Peace""
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
""Life is short"" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses

It's all poison
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices

When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial, hateful
Toward themselves, denyin' even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods, but I
Overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

Yo, it's poison
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Radio and TV, poison
White Jesus, poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint them, plaow

Never to worry
All the wrong-doers got it comin' back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it comin' back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse
But we'll get through it, y'all, be strong

The China-man built the railroad
The Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return, the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday ""Hell-day""
'Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts e'ryday like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party e'ryday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

It's all poison
All of my words to enemies, it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MC's? You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is all poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint them, plaow

What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga

The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga (Uh)
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga

This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C
This is the problem, 'cause he never tell 'em he got it
From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rockin' they shirts in bitches' faces like clockwork
""What's your name? Where you from?""
Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb
Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head? He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin' in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin' on niggas' dreams
They leave, when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' they seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em, they spendin' money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies 'cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you, now you old and you gettin' shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know, the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush-killer 'til George Bush kills me
Much blessings, be healthy, remember

Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog, whatever they call you, God, just listen
I'll spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in this chest of a nigga, now he back to square one
Screamin', ""shoot don't please"", I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van, they closin' shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""Go he there""
Sittin' back in his chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""Outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, ""Block your on enemy's the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""No hell,"" she talkin' 'bout, ""Me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""Stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, ""Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill""

Ayo, son, ayo, son, you hear me? You hear me?
Listen, man
This dude right on the block right now, man
I found him, right now, I see him right now
Let's kill him
Yo, this Nas, leave it, peace"
Nas,Trust,"July 13, 2012","It's like a cold story.. repeated over and over
In the winters of my mind, yeah
This shit be real, man..
Shit's crazy out here..
Yo yo, yo what up y'all?
That's my niggas over there, word

If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot, then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin' just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me
It's a lesson every premonition
Lot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

It's been so long, can't remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off
I see your moms, she still speak
She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
It's old shit, see, forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It's quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder, will it change? Let's ride…

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word ""fresh"" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?

Some place you wouldn't know probably
Yeah, yeah

If Chappelle moved to Ghana to find his peace then I'm rollin'
Where the service always roamin', I'm packin' my bags and goin'
It's a challenge in that, it's a balancin' act
Visit beautiful places, there's more out here than the trap
Houses in Long Island, they always found 'em
House in the South, a nigga barely got out
Sunny L.A., remеmber calls with Dr. Dre
He told mе, ""Don't let the palm trees fool you, nigga, be safe""
Me and my higher self, we often would speak
Somehow we lost the connection, might meet at Joshua Tree
And it's been bothering me, too many wavy women
Gotta log outta IG, can't be my age DM'in' (Haha)
No kiddin', it's hard to move like a civilian
I write the truth 'cause I live it, not like you musical niggas
We did it big and they bigots, they'd rather shoot than write tickets
What it feel like to go get it? What it feel like to go miss it?

In one city, one country, one state
Some place to be nobody
Some place to be
Some place you wouldn't know probably
Some place to be nobody

My dawg bought a plane, said ""Let's go to Paris""
That's where baguettes are from, French bread that's long and narrow
I like the other definition, rectangular carats
The concept of this song is rather esoteric
This girl said in Grenada we should go get married
Broke the meanin' down of the Virgin Mary
And you got your own place
My favorite part of the night when you text me that you made it home safe (
I'm home
)
I'm contemplatin' at the home base
How I'm used to breakfast in the ghetto, sippin' OJ
That's a picture right there, a moment in time
Before anybody wanted a photo of mine
Before the internet energy and social decline
Destroyed the vibe, foolin' us with the headlines
(Keepin' us blind) Vultures eat you alive
(Take heed to the signs) Wishin' I'd find

One city, one country, one state
Some place to be nobody
Some place to be
Some place you wouldn't know probably
Some place to be nobody (Life)

All my time has been focused on my freedom now
Why would I join 'em when I know that I can beat 'em now?
They put their words on me, and they can eat 'em now
That's probably why they keep on tellin' me I'm needed now
They tried to box me out while takin' what they want from me
I spent too many years livin' too uncomfortably
Making room for people who didn't like the labor
But wanted the spoils, greedy, selfish behavior
Now let me give it to you balanced and with clarity
I don't need to turn myself into a parody
I don't, I don't do the shit you do for popularity
They clearly didn't understand when I said, ""I Get Out"" apparently
My awareness like Keanu in 
The Matrix
I'm savin' souls and y'all complainin' 'bout my lateness
Now it's illegal for someone to walk in greatness
They want the same shh, but they don't take risks
Now the world will get to see its own reflection
And the anointed can pursue their own direction
And if you're wrong and you're too proud to hear correction
Walk into the hole you dug yourself, fuck a projection
See me in my freedom takin' all my land back
They said a lot against me thinkin' I'd just stand back
I got my legs beneath me, I got my hands back
A lot of people sabotaged, they couldn't stand that
I turned the other cheek, I took blow after blow
There's so much crisis in the world 'cause you reap what you sow
When you keep what you know is meant for someone else
The ditch you dig for them, you might just end up in yourself
I'm in the secret place, I keep a sacred space
They keep showin' their hands, but keep hidin' their face
If I'm a messenger, you block me then you block the message
So aggressive, the world you made is what you're left with
Pride and ego over love and truth is fuckin' reckless
Y'all niggas got a death wish, the stupid leaves me breathless

Some place to be, yeah
Ain't duckin' nothin'
Just might have to build my own city
Where y'all need a real nigga passport to enter
Ms. Hill, we ain't goin' nowhere
They gon' have to deal with us
Make 'em uncomfortable, hahaha, yeah"
Nas,Black Republican,"December 19, 2006","[Intro: Jay-Z, (
Nas
) & 
both
]
I know you can feel the magic, baby
Turn the motherfuckin' lights down
Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?)
I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha)
Let's go... 
uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (Yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (Hahaha!)
Make niggas mad and shit like...
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, ""Nigga, go in!""
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah, (Yeah...) we just come outta nowhere

I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (
Nah
)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, ""Fuck it then""
[Verse 1: Jay-Z, (
Nas
)]
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (What?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (
Uhh
), ""all good things...""
Never thought we'd sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all woodgrain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign could bring
Should blame–the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes, it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although, we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things, like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin – cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef, between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy, indefinitely

I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (Uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (
Nah
)
Probably end up back in the hood (
Uh
), I'm like, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the governmentCan't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (Nah)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""

I'm back in the hood, they like, ""Hey, Nas"" (
Uh
)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (
Uh
)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, haters wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, ""Why""? (
Uhh
)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep trying, follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat, ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid turn illegal for commerce (
Uhh
)
To get his feet out of them Converse, that's my word

I feel like a Black Republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (Uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (
Nah
)
Probably end up back in the hood (
Uhh
), ah, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant, takin' over the governmentCan't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (I got love for them)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then"""
Eminem,Rap God,"October 14, 2013","""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (
Six minutes—, six minutes—
)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (
Kill 'em all with
)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of 
shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from 
The Mathers LP 1
 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (
J.J. Fad
)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for 
Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?"
Eminem,Lose Yourself,"October 28, 2002","Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music

Eminem,Mockingbird,"November 12, 2004","Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back onto Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, Mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad (Haha)"

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Eminem,The Real Slim Shady,"April 18, 2000","May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam; like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the 
Discovery Channel
, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha-ha
I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up"
Eminem,Stan,"May 23, 2000","My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, PS: We should be together too

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

Dear Mr. I'm Too Good to Call or Write My Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: You coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim, shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you
Damn"
Eminem,Killshot,"September 14, 2018","You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 
8 Mile
 on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo""
So before you die, let's see who can out-petty who
Wit' your corny lines (""Slim, you're old""), ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you (Woo)
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material, dictionary
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to 
Recovery
,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be eighty-year-old me than twenty-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a ten-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddie, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay, so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven, you'd look up to me
And for the record, you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This motherfuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells, attempt fails, Budden, L's
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin'—, oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you"

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter
, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
Here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

Still a white jerk
Pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher with the vic's, percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician, an electrician y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me

Ate but I will hit an eight year old in the face with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout to turn into some girl scouts

To shut me down so when I started this verse
It did start off light-hearted at first
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed, look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all have been light joggin' and I've been running at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin, and I'm the fight y'all get in

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say
(If what?) If he could see the way shit is today
(Look at this shit, man) He'd probably say that everything is gay
(Like happy!) What's my name, what's my name?

So, how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be
And that's why these words sting, just like you were being attacked by bees
In the coupe leaning back my seat
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group, the black guy pee's
In my Air Max 90's
White T's walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
Identifies as black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' hacky sack I treat the whole world, 'cause I got it at my feet
How can I explain to you?
That even myself, I'm a danger too
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me what? Okay, that's it, go ahead, Paul, quit
Snake-ass prick, you male crossdresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that
(Watch) But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you, fuck my own kids they're brats (Fuck 'em)
They can screw-off, them and you all
You too, Paul, got two balls, big as RuPaul's, what you thought you saw ain't what you saw
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini, I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving, like

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh"
Eminem,Superman,"May 26, 2002","Mhm
You high, baby?
Yeah, hahahaha
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday (
Yeah-yeah
)
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked, bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your body goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

First thing you say:
""I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me""
Ooh, yeah, girl, run that game
""Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
'Rot In Pieces', uh, that's great""
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

Eminem,The Monster,"October 29, 2013","I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame but not the cover of 
Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it
All could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes, I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down
Yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MCs, blood gets spilled then I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million who are goin' through a
Struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft turn nothin' into somethin'
Still can make that straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts:
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

Eminem,Lucky You,"August 31, 2018","Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo), give me some room (Hey), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo), give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yeah)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo, woo)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom)

I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo)

I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, 
y'all gotta move
Give me some room
 (
Woo

, give me some room 
(
Hey

, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe

, hop out the coupe

Eminem,’Till I Collapse,"May 26, 2002","(
Yo, left, yo, left
) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
(
Yo, left, right, left
) Feel weak, and when you feel weak
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) You feel like you wanna just give up
(
Yo, left, right, left
) But you gotta search within you
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
(
Yo, left, right, left
) And get that motivation to not give up
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) And not be a quitter
(
Yo, left, right, left
) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, this shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me

'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

Eminem,Love the Way You Lie,"June 18, 2010","Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you"" — ""No, you ain't
Come back"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that’s the culprit, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"
Eminem,The Ringer,"August 31, 2018","*Plane crash*
Yeah (
Illa, Illa, Illa
)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an MC
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (
Illa, Illa, Illa
)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of 
The Mathers LP
 to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing 
Recovery
 clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get 
Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (
Illa, Illa, Illa
)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date"" — ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"
Eminem,Venom,"August 31, 2018","I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya

Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

Eminem,River,"December 15, 2017","I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
River 
(Ooh)
, river run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
River (Ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (
I'm sorry
)
I don't want to admit to something (
I fucked up
)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"
Eminem,8 Mile: B-Rabbit vs Papa Doc,"September 8, 2002","Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up! Look, look
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin' here screaming, ""Fuck the Free World!""
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go acappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

Yo..."
Eminem,Cleanin’ Out My Closet,"May 26, 2002","Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
'Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 
The Eminem Show

I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cocksucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na (Yeah)
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun


And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But, just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock Demigod
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, lettin' off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry (Yeah, uh), Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off of ya
Better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'd be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hangin' open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw 'way the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I'll blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
A double-edge sword, it cuts both ways, I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimum
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fuckin' invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical ('Dentical), but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster (Yeah)

That's how much we have in common (Yeah)
That's how much we have in common (Woah)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yeah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah)
That's how much we have in common (Woo)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us—

Man, fuck this shit
Let's go"
Eminem,Berzerk,"August 27, 2013","Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.​
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody
 (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.​
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody
 (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls


And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are, though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And, girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? (
Word, man, you heard
)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.​

Eminem,Fall,"August 31, 2018","(Photoshoot)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say (Nope)
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid"" (Yeah)
One last time for Charlamagne, if my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away (Woo)
These rappers are like Hunger Games, one minute, they're mockin' JAY (Yeah)
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate, I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once (Yeah)
You wanted Shady? You got him
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & 
Eminem
]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr)
Don't fall on my fate (Ha)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly (Yeah)
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen, you know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup, hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up"" (Huh?)—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters, the fans waited for this moment
Like that feature when I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Haha)
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & 
Eminem

Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Haha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I'ma have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew (Ah)
Just what the doctor ordered, revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most, and then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Haha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest, I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists on a scale of ""turnt"", you're ""minus""
Mine says ""very"", yours says ""hardly"", and what's scary is you prob'ly
Can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the Hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone, walk up in this house you own
Thrust my pelvic bone, use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch (Yeah)

It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire"
Eminem,Beautiful,"May 15, 2009","Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down then I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt
To vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat
On my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen
Stop sign pole at eight-years-old
I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't
Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably a 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a
Mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own (
Oh
)
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone (
So
)
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through? (
Oh
)
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you (
So
)

Yeah
To my babies:
Stay strong
Dad'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world:
God gave you those shoes
To fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are
And even if it sounds corny
Don't never let no one tell you
You ain't beautiful (So-oh-oh-oh-oh)"
Eminem,The Way I Am,"May 23, 2000","Man, whatever
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag of this weed
It gives me the shit needed to be the most meanest MC on this—
On this Earth, and since birth, I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently
Off of this chest, and I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
Do not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and, no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
No patience is in me, and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me, just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom, and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at?
And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see
An upper-class city havin' this happenin'
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way, but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired that I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (
Argh
)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand, and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am"
Eminem,When I’m Gone,"December 6, 2005","Yeah, it's my life (
Hey, Hailie
)
In my own words, I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on, and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'""
""But, baby, wait!"" ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you, you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"", and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""
Slim Shady, you a basehead
"" (Uh-uh)
""
Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted
""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Heh, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter

Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-you collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-overstayed my welcome
Stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (Oh, yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents, and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, ""FACK,"" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (
Ooh
)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, ""FACK,"" 2017

Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (Kamikaze)
Look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass, it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it (Get it)
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn, stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot, oh, yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?) Twelve inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep, you're fucked, other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so, when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot"
Eminem,Bad Guy,"November 5, 2013","[
Part I
]

It's like I'm in the dirt, diggin' up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight, bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this!""
Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset""

I flee the scene
Like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth
But it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-run, follow me, I ruh-uh-run)
I just hate to be the bad–

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long that I've stopped the plotting
And still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on ya
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

I flee the scene
Like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth
But it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un, follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-run, follow me, I ruh-uh, ruh-uh-un)

I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally, I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waitin' on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm duckin' on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential – I peeked (Haha)
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now—wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials, I initially was
Gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear?
Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Agh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again
[
Part II
]

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closin' in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm that denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stackin' up all them odds, toilets clogged
Yeah, 'cause I'm talkin' a lot of shit, but I'm backin' it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears, I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged, grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered comin' back on ya
Every woman you insult, batter
But the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowin' what you had 'til it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, ""I told you so""
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip, the baggage you have, but
As you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop

So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable;
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as I pick up where the last Mathers left off"
Eminem,Walk on Water,"November 10, 2017","I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (
Fuck
)

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter-
​flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(
It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—
)
I walk on water (
Shit
)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage""
God's given me all this, still, I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—
)
But only when it freezes
(
It's true—
)

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times, juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-
​pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""
Eminem,Not Afraid,"April 29, 2010","(I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid) Yeah
(To take a stand, to take a stand) It's been a ride
(Everybody, everybody) I guess I had to
(Come take my hand, come take my hand) Go to that place to get to this one
(We'll walk this road together, through the storm) Now some of you
(Whatever weather, cold or warm) Might still be in that place
(Just lettin' you know that you're not alone) If you're tryna get out
(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From 
Infinite
 down to the last 
Relapse
 album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game like a ""Fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last 
Relapse
 CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, same road)

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, same-)"
Eminem,Sing for the Moment,"May 26, 2002","These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problemed child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, durags, and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & 
Eminem
]
(
Come on
) Sing with me (
Sing
), sing for the year (
Sing it
)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (
Come on
)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Uh-huh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great (Ugh)
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So, I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b'
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Bitch)
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & 
Eminem
]
(
Come on
) Sing with me (
Sing
), sing for the year (
Sing it
)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (
Sing that shit
)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think this shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Haha)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can—
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & 
Eminem
]
Sing with me (
Sing
), sing for the year (
Sing it
)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (
Come on
)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
[Outro: Steven Tyler & 
Eminem
]
Sing with me (
Sing
), sing for the year (
Sing it
)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (
Come on
)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away"
Eminem,Like Toy Soldiers,"November 12, 2004","Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step (Oh), heart to heart (
Heart to heart
)
Left, right, left, we all fall down (All fall down, all fall down; 
all fall down
)
Like toy soldiers (Oh)
Bit by bit (
Bit by bit
), torn apart (
Torn apart
)
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just out of respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me, ""Stay out,"" this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause

Step by step (Oh), heart to heart (
Heart to heart
)
Left, right, left, we all fall down (All fall down, all fall down; 
all fall down
)
Like toy soldiers (Oh)
Bit by bit (
Bit by bit
), torn apart (
Torn apart
)
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you callin' names, and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him, mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at 
The Source
 who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.​
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience, 'cause

Step by step (Oh), heart to heart (
Heart to heart

Left, right, left, we all fall down (All fall down, all fall down; 
all fall down

Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (
Love
)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away, man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage? Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down

To spaz with the pen

Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in

Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em

So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (
Yeah

Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (
Yeah

You can see the sparks from hot metal (

Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted

Aw, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! (
Okay!
)
[Verse 1: Eminem & 
Kim
]
Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out? That's fine""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him
He ain't so hot now, is he? Little punk
(
Why are you doing this?!
) Shut the fuck up! (You're drunk!)
(You're never gonna get away with this) You think I give a fuck?
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (
No!
) Sit up front
(
We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?

We'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(
I love you
) What are you doing? Change the station
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (
No
)
There's a **** year old little ****
Laying dead with a slit throat, in your living room
Haha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him, didn't you? (
No
)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you? (
It's not that
) No, you think I'm ugly
(
Baby
) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you
Oh my God, I love you How the fuck could you do this to me?

I'm sorry
) How the fuck could you do this to me?

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong

You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault

Hey, 'member the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (
No

And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(
Oh my God
)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat (
No

So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We could've—, hey, where you going? Get back here
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah! Somebody help""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

Look at that bitch
Oh, shit, hey (Damn)

There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet

Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah

Knows that she can, but she won't say no

Sexy as can be
Tonight, I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me

Eminem,Headlights,"November 5, 2013","Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's fifteen degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

‘Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it, though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful, though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left, I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
[Verse 3: Nate Ruess & 
Eminem

I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright

On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feel like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

Greatest in the world (Yeah)
Greatest in the world (Yeah)
Greatest in the world (Yeah)
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it (Yeah)
The best to ever do it (Yeah)
The best to ever do it (Yeah)
I feel like the greatest (Yeah)
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good (Yeah)
Never be as good (Yeah)
(Packing up) Wife-beaters, white t-shirts, what?
But I'm the greatest

So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha, wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, ""Die Antwoord""
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget though, and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it (Yeah)
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Greatest in the world (Yeah)

No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it (Yeah)

Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good (Yeah)
Never be as good (Yeah)
(Packing up) Wife-beaters, white t-shirts, what?
But I'm the greatest

Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension (Woo)
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene (Pew)
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the Sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding (Ding) hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling (Ow)
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day (Hey) I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world (Yeah)

Eminem,Survival,"August 14, 2013","Yeah

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck, I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you
Self-esteem must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all"
Eminem,Kill You,"May 23, 2000","When I was just a little baby boy
My mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But, then, I got a little bit older and I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ah)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore?
'Til the vocal cords won't work in her throat no more? (Ah)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ah)
Put your hands down, bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (Ah)
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay, Ma?
""Oh, now he's rapin' his own mother
Abusin' a whore, snortin' coke and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?""
You goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum, and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious
Vain Vicodin, vrin, vrin, vrin
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch, I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither
You ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you
You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'ma be another rapper dead for poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too
You ain't nothin' but a girl to me (I said)

You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you

(Bitch, I'ma kill you) like a murder weapon
I'ma conceal you in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows, and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops, is that a subliminal hint? No
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth (Ah)
Bitch, I'ma kill you
I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material in a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me

'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Haha)

Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These eighty Gs a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink
Fuck that
I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before-school or outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leavin' air in your lungs just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.​
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on 'til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me

Or I'ma kill you

Eminem,Marshall Mathers,"May 23, 2000","You know, I just don't get it
Last year, I was nobody
This year, I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me
Ten-million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here

You see, I'm just Marshall
Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the
Fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did
Was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to
Take shots at me (Take shots at me)

Yo
You might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin' (Ruff ruff)
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Rémy Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin' (Hee-hee!)
Whatever happened to wilin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick
Boy, girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (Hahaha)
Vanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh), he said some shit in 
Vibe
 to spite me (Yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' ""I don't care, just bite me!"" (Na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer (Hehe)
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (Ah!)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus""? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

'Cause I'm just Marshall
Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out
If you talk about me (Talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes
Doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot
At me (Best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a three-sixty
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's sued me for ten-million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter,  faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden, I got ninety-some cousins (Hey, it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help (Uh, here!)
""
XXL
!

Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? 'Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic

And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal!

The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-

He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it (Go, go, go!)
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass

And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

(I am) I'm a criminal!"
Eminem,Space Bound,"June 18, 2010","We touch, I feel a rush
We clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't jokin' when I told you you take my breath away
You're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one?
And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I woulda done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you
Without you"
Eminem,Love Game,"November 5, 2013","Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (Out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust, judgement is clouded, must
Just be the powder from the power of 
love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan?
And the further I walk, the louder (
Ah
)
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
'Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts, brace
Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo""
'Cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario
Though in the first place (Ah, fuck)
But you confirmed my low-end theory though (Ah)
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
""No, you don't understand
I don't do this for anyone ever""
Yeah, that ain't what they all say? I'll say
You can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, JAY, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
'Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin' (Ha)
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the

Game of 
love,
 love, 
love,
 love
La-la-la-la-la-love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

And I told her, ""Go where you wanna
Go do what you wanna do, I don't care""
And I told her, ""Go where you wanna
Go do what you wanna do, I don't care""

I told that bitch, ""I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick""
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned
Like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
""Sherane is not available, now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day,"" bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me? You cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', ""I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile, you're chasin' her""
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with her

Game of 
love,

La-la-la-la-la-love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more

She screamed she loved me like she never did before

And I told her, ""Go where you wanna
Go do what you wanna do, I don't care""
And I told her, ""Go where you wanna
Go do what you wanna do, I don't care""

So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed, snatch my house key off her keychain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick, now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an instant replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin', but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch, cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, ""Okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?""
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She's screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat, like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up, like, ""Fuck it, I've had it
I'm checkin' into rehab,"" I confess I'm a static addict
I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch, combative, possessive
In fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, ""Hit the road"", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, ""Be careful drivin'
Don't read this and have an accident""
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin' ""rape""
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of
Wait, ""dinner at eight""?
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly 'cause of the

Eminem,Unaccommodating,"January 17, 2020","Oh, this what we doin'? Alright
M.A

I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it, uh
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real (What is that?)
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill everybody, Drake mode (Hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat, I'll take your plate mode (Hello)
Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up, Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

Game ov' (Over), Thanos on you H-Os
On my petty shit, but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger), 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like it leaked off Detox
You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
Please, dog, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
Apeshit, Beyoncé, JAY-Z (Woo)
And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)
And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke, but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling in dough
And I keep it one comma zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated twenty-two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me is simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B-Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal, that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed

They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating"

Eminem,Legacy,"November 5, 2013","Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him
[Pre-Chorus: Polina & (
Eminem

And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from (
Yeah
) all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, ""That's right, fight's on, bitch!""
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'

The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my—

Eminem,White America,"May 26, 2002","(
The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only, no parking
)
America, hahaha, we love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get (Yo)
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby, 
Ooh, baby,
 look at my sales
Let's do the math: if I was Black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was White
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan Black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every White fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this

I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get (Yo)
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

See, the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot,"" shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get (Yo)
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have, fuck you
Hahaha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you"

That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (At me with machine guns; brr)

Still stackin' my chips, hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play, childrеn
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (What?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (Yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Haha, yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (Yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (Fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (Straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause

d.a. got that dope
 he sends to me (Uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (What?), that's social distancing (Yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (Shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask)
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (Damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem
Like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare'll end, like Monroe, Norma Jeane (Norma Jeane)
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (Dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (Nope)
For some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (Yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (Mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (Woah)
I got a contact like eyewear (Woah)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (Uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me ODin'
Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the GOAT
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault (A salt)
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (
Dope
)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like Hell, shit, I'm anxious as Hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, 'cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*), ""Back is the incredible!""
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed (Uh)
It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"" (""Oh, oh, oh, oh!"")
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic whose eyes get so squinted
I'm blind from smoke in 'em with my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from

I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a .9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time (Ahh-! Ahh-ahh-!)
'Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?

I'm Slim Shady (*scratch*- Slim, I'm back)

Come to my side of town
Lately, it’s been goin', goin', goin', goin', goin' down
 (Look, uh, look)

All of my niggas gon' ride with it
In the pocket, the rocket like Kellen Mond
Mama told me the power was in the tongue
But it probably ain't powerful as a gun
All of you little cowards get devoured, I’m givin’ out flowers to anyone
I ain't been out the house in a minute ’cause I ain't wit' it if the money is miniature
I been mindin' my business, I’m business-minded
I been spendin' some time with the minister
'Cause them niggas spinnin' shit and still sinnin' in the City of God and it's sinister
Try to pray and rеpent in a synagogue or a mosque, a tеmple, a church
Them brown skin's sentiment niggas hurtin'
And murder's a common courtesy, for certainly
R.I.P. be on the shirt, search, lurk, murk, squirt, dirt, first (
Forty-eight
)
My nigga doin' four plus eight without a court date
Talked the other day, he say he doin' okay
He good, he gainin' weight, then got a sharp shank
He made, he say they play, they gotta partake
Homie got a heart full of hate and a face full of war paint
Eyes all red, full of rage and it's hard to escape from a dark place
East side niggas from the A, niggas all ages
Tryna sell a pound of the dog cage
All the OGs 'round town was our age
Danger, sex, and drugs, X and R-rated
Danger, sex, and drugs, shit be outrageous
But don't get this shit fucked up, my boy
Ya lucked up once, then ya doubled up
I dribble and pass it to the cup and triple-double it
Get to the basket, get the cash and cuddle up
Cover up, bundle up, batter up (Batter up)
Um, talk a lot of smack and I could back it up
Shawty wanna shag, wanna shack it up
I can put her pussy on the platter like a platypus
Nappy-head nigga, hair natted up
I said, ""Barbara,"" a nigga tatted up
I won't argue, nigga mad as fuck
'Cause they ain't compatible, I'm finna catapult
But niggas know it's goin'
(Down, down, down, down, do-do-do-do—)

If I run out of fuel, I won't
What the fuck y'all gon' do if I don't
Run out of fuel? (
Down, down, down, down, do-do-do-do—

That scares the fuck out of you

For a couple decades (Brrt)
Been lettin' this TEC spray (Brrt)
From that day that I met Dre (Brrt)
So you liable to catch strays (Brrt)
From the second you press play (What?)
I suggest they (What?)
Do not test like an essay (Why?)
'Cause like where my homies out west stay (Yeah)
We can just say (What?)
I'm like an R-A-P-E-R (Yeah)
Got so many eses (Eses), S-As (Huh)
Wait, he didn't just spell the word ""rapper"" and leave out a P, did he? (Yep)
R.I.P., rest in peace, Biggie
And Pac, both of y'all should be living (Yep)
But I ain't tryna beef with him (Nope)
'Cause he might put a hit on me like, ""Keefe D, get 'em""
And that's the only way you're gonna be killing me (Nah)
Ain't gonna be on no beat, silly (Yeah)
I beat the beat silly, on the grind like teeth gritting
Call me ""obesity"" (Why?)
You think it's over? Wait, it's just beginning
Diss me and it ain't gonna be pretty (Nah)
Used to be yea tall, then I grew a little each day 'til I became God
Like James Todd, now your arms are too short to BK brawl
Indeed, they small like DJ Paul (Woo)
My new Benz better than your truck by far
Bitch, suck my balls
You either smoke crack or you're playin' stickball in the street
'Cause you must be on base if you thinkin' you could touch my car (Yeah)
But if the whole world was out to get you (What?)
It'd turn you to a powder keg too
Kyle Rittenhouse, spittin' rounds, the TEC shoots like (Look out, brrt)
And that ain't no sound effect (Woo)
Neither was that, SIG Sauer lets loose
I don't condone gun violence at schools (Nah)
But I can't get these voices out my head (Hey, Marshall, kill, kill, kill)
They're putting words in my mouth like alphabet soup
Got the most content on the continent
And constant compliments give me confidence (I'm a)
To cross of common sense and incompetence (Uh)
I'm cognizant that conflict's a consequence (What?)
Of accomplishments and comp is no competish
I've conquered and conked 'em into unconsciousness
No conscience, I conjure this King Kong or just
Call me ""Kamikaze,"" I'm concoctin' this (Woo, my bad)
But nobody's sixteens are touchin' these
My fuckin' index fingers fuckin' the nina
Clutchin' the 9 millimeter, tuckin' the heat
Got the toaster like an English muffin
No, I mean ""toast to"" like you drink to somethin'
But it's in a holster, I proceed to bustin'
Fuck around and get popped like Halyna Hutchins
Like I'm Alec Baldwin, what I mean is buckin' you down
Coup de grâce then, right between the fuckin' eyes
Shoot 'em all in, if you think you're fuckin' with me
You're gonna suffer the fuckin' repercussions
The reaper's comin', a heathen, I'm Ethan Crumbley
I keep replenishing fuel while the beat I'm punishing

If I run out of fuel, I won't
What the fuck y'all gon' do if I don't
Run out of fuel? (

Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really, really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (
Yeah
)
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know 
I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really, I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster!

So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (
More

You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (
Safe

Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (

To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted, Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with '
Chance 3
'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Um—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dotsA country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said, ""Baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy""

Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I 'member Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It just mean, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me (
Los Angeles
)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)
Big, big money (Money, money, money)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla—, pla—, pla—

Someday, we gon' set it off
Someday, we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday, the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes, I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind
But maybe someday

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Woah, once again, I am a child
I let it all go of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' 'round lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have

You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week, he moppin' floors, next week, it's the fries
So stick by his side

And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl

I embody every characteristic of the egotistic

I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder

See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye

I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing, too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn, I forgot to call her, shit, I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry? Uh

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young, I used to make time

You say, ""I'm good, I'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended?

We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make-up, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wanted, huh?""

Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender

Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder

Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns

La, la, la-la (
Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life, homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, ""Back in my day""
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then

You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, ""Why, God?""
When they reminisce over you, my God

La, la, la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la

Back in the lab and shit

My wife said I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate, we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That 
TIME
 cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, ""How my neck look?""
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (
Real!
)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky

Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truth stay sober
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

(All of the lights), lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (All of the lights)

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Them courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

Kanye West,Gorgeous,"November 22, 2010","Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a 
South Park
 writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down"
Kanye West,Dark Fantasy,"November 22, 2010","You might think you've peeped the scene

Twisted fictions, sick addiction

And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Can we get much higher? (So high)

Bitch, I'm back out my coma, wakin' up on your sofa
When I parked my Range Rover, slightly scratched your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla, I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years, we been over, ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own you, one more fuck and I can own you
One cold night in October, pussy had me floatin', feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead, might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa, these the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober, you love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja

Skinny bitch with no shoulders, tellin' you that I'm bogus

Remember that last time, the episode?

Four times just to say, ""Don't text me, ho""
Told you four times, ""Don't test me, ho""

But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar

All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me

An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove', leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin', I own you all, yuugh

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment, ""Thou shalt not hate, kid""
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

Ayy, yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh?"

Kanye West,Blame Game,"November 22, 2010","Whose fault?

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

On the bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing

I thank you, my dick thanks you
How'd you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before
I was in there like, ""Oh shit, I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before""
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?
(
Yeezy reupholstered my pussy

You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him
I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker
I'ma shoot a bootlegger
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Ah
I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
With the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in 
The Source
I 'member, Twista had this motherfucker on in 
The Source
That's right, that's right

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that

Kanye West,Through the Wire,"September 30, 2003","(
Through the test of time
)
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye To The…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody order pancakes, I'll just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-izz-O’s back to w-izz-ork
How do you console my mom, or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she 
been
 throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I've been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire; ha–I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make Da Band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize to everyone right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said, like, six weeks
Y'know, he had–I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror–half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds, 
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, 
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank 
God
 I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to 
God
, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe–safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in 
Vanilla Sky
, it was televised
""There's been an accident,"" like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable
, what you thought, they call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past (Uh-huh)
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid  that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph (Uh-huh! Yeah!)
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire (Woo!)

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had to, um...
I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin...
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
She can't be serious, man

Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire..."

All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it

I know You won't (Oh), oh (Oh, yeah)
I know You won't, I know that You look over us (I know)

Bring down the rain, yeah, oh

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple

I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons talk on my shoulder

Kanye West,I Thought About Killing You,"June 1, 2018","[Intro: Francis and the Lights & 
Kanye West
]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay"

Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs

But if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' 'bout
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now"
Kanye West,Only One,"December 31, 2014","As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, ‘cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
‘Cause every road that leads to Heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello, my only one, remember who you are
No, you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey, hey, one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no, you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello, my only one, remember who you are
You got the world ‘cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day, you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me..."

He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words, I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you

Don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You goin' out the country
You posting up on IG
I'm laid up with my sidepiece

I don't want 'er cause she from the corner

Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Corona's

On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever

Just in case you recognize her face, send 'er to me

Either you a rebel or what we doin'?
Toast codeine, trap stars, what we doin'?
A few remain nameless deserve my dedication
I just want my movement like Larry Davis
Came from Amsterdam, had my head up
Screenshot bitches got me fed up
Playin' with the white for green like a Celtic
She ain't tryna share me, she thinkin' selfish
I just bought my young bitch some new Rosettas
Went to Tokyo, I had to hit the ghetto
Like to kick it with her 'cause she play soccer
Introduced her to some goons, nigga, and some robbers
Now she want that Bentayga and it's obvious
Real patience for them big faces and I got it
Still faded from the last night off molly

I just left Onyx and caught a body
Fuck your wife at the back of King of Diamonds
Turn me on, she don't care I put my thumb in

Try my best to love you in this world we in
Take another look at every foreign I'm in
End up with the bitches that I started with
I must've been on a pill when I recorded this
Had the stick in my hand while I was typin' it
I know I'm arrogant, but don't be trifling
I iced out you once and you got iced again
These guitars sound like Parliament
I just blowed a check, baby, pardon me
All-black trim, dark burgundy
Keep it real with me, no perjury
Put them bags on her arm like weighed sand
Saks Fifth Avenue, she ran through eighty bands
Got your passport ready, we some aliens
Got my transporter up out my radius
Got my transporter, whip Mercedes-Benz
I could never give up on what we had
Abracadabra, make my side bitch better
Chanel trench, pussy taste like pineapple
I'ma stay down with you, but don't give me a headache
Lifestyle's radical, please excuse the medies
California housing, gettin' better with my veggies
Audemars, Richard Mille came in a FedEx
Smash her like a grudge that I ain't never gettin' deaded
Sippin' on mud while I'm lookin' at my presi'
Presidential tints in the back, I done made it
Bitch, you better stay on your shit, you gettin' graded
Take you to a spa in Saint Barts, is you ready?
Whip the double-R with the stars in the headrest
Caught up with these broads, baby, did I change the address?
Times got hard and I fucked off your lashes
Everything real, I got my gold veneers added

Cut off all my hoes, now I'm only puttin' you in a song
Day one, shawty been with me from the playground
Hey now, maybe that's the reason I was playin' 'round
Runnin' like a chicken with his head cut off
Through the streets where the freaks love the red leather
On my shoulder blades, in my older age
See the error of my ways, but I'm still not totally over all the temptation
Why does sin give you all the sensation?
Yeah, I'm with Future up in Onyx just wastin'
A lot of money on a stripper education
Throw so much paper that we causin' the inflation
Now it's late and I'm gettin' impatient
Might run a train on a bitch, Penn Station
Nah, I'm playin', I'm just lit, gettin' wasted
And she whisper in my ear she wanna taste it
Damn, you makin' it hard for me
But I'm stayin' strong, I got authority
Willpower, when I dub a baddie, I feel power
Me and Astro 6'4"", we the Twin Towers
Twin Glocks with the switch piece that extend shots
It's a metaphor for the boy when you in proximity
I can't stop right now, they gon' remember me forever
My stories more clever, my similes was better
My energy was never on some toughest nigga shit
I was just a conscious rapper that would fuck a nigga bitch
I was just a college nigga from a rougher premises
Kept my nose out the streets, but I love to get a whiff
Of the action, with risk comes attraction
The blicks get to blastin', I turn into a track star
Wanted all the hoes, what the fuck you think I rap for?
I been tryna slang the same wood since Hacksaw
Jim Duggan, runnin' through the Ville in my Timbs, thuggin'
Now I'm with Young Metro in the V.I.P., bitches incomin'
Coppin' all this liquor for these hoes like we McLovin
Thinkin' to myself, ""Could I really be with one woman?""
Hmm, I think so
But it's hard when you with your dogs at the freak show
Thinkin' I could bag Rubi Rose with a keystroke
Ego, ask yourself is that gon' bring you peace, though?

In the paddie wagon and it had me numb
The pain from the slum had me numb
Tryna sell some dope and eat caviar
Got the passport in Saudi Arabia
We've been flossing in medallions
We ain't nothing but some Talibans

Lately I've been hanging around with my savages
I grew up on the block, one hunnid
I go on The Bluff, it's one hunnid
I done did enough in the jungle

Had the blow at the store, they was lurking
Poured a four in a cup it was breakfast
Sprinkled sauce in my drink and I took it

Chop it up with a sack chaser
Told you I wasn't going back, baby
Hanging out with some crack babies
Fell in love with this cash baby
Money touch a niggas hands
On a few Xans might won't count it
Spend it all in one night
If we could rewind it, we'll still do it
I'm true to this game, I jump on a plane
And run to the stage
I've been working some years for this
Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it
You know I'm gon' do the whole dash in this motherfucker

Sippin' on Easter Pink like it's Tanqueray
We ain't never gon' give this perfect life up
I know the boys saying they gettin' to the money over there
Baby, trust me, these niggas nothin' like us
I put charisma in my lingo and she fell for me
I gave her realness, and that’s all she gonna get from me
Bona fide superstar, I'm straight up out the hood-uh
I just did a dose of Percocets with some strippers

I just did a dose of Percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, it feel good

Treasure bring misery, codeine in my delivery
I pulled up in a big B, swervin' like a hippie
Movin' with the dopers and pushers
In the Rover duckin' undercover, huggin' the Interstate
Coppin' a couple cakes and the drum hangin' under me
Got a chain hangin' over me
God watching over me, all my angels watch over me
I bag it like groceries, keep some cash flowing over me
Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me
The young niggas under me, they gon' stand up in any war
We built this shit ground up like the head of a seminar
I talk for the real ones
I talk for them niggas that feel this shit out in Belgium
Freeband Gang

I just did a dose of Percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system

I was in the U.K. thinkin' – shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a P.Y.T
I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathe
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Y'all done drank my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly since a diesel
Made her switch sides in Ibizoo
I can get you off there in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chicks, then mail them
Take it to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum-sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga, I got the set for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change family, that's the way it is
Fame change a ho, that's the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

I ain't really mean to hurt you

It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the fuckin' carpet, hit 'em with the two
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I been put up against, baby?
You see why I been tryna make the rent, baby?
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Diamond Rolls, 'bout to get Lynch, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motor's my confession
Tryin' to identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept it

I ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way

Chop this up for me, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycod' got me floatin' up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up, an' it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost doe
Aye – my Lamb' hit a pothole, these bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mijaña
Yolanda, Shalonda, mi añá muy paza
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa, Messiah, then higher
Gold sheets and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my whodie, he smashin' the CO
My wrist got a ego, my watch in an igloo
We took it legal, got stripes like a zebru
Live like a Rolling Stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just all on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E, I hope you ain’t gettin' greedy
Chasers do numbers, man, chains is on Fiji
Couldn'ta had your heart, 'cause ya gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight that's way brighter than Geezy's
Shout out to D.D., got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had evaded, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian, super sensation
Yah – sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches be tradin'
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never worn me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, it's so easy gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy

Future,Life Is Good (Remix),"February 15, 2020","Say she want to eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Anything she want, she cashin' out without no problems
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't got love for your mama?
You can die today, it ain't gon' save me nothin' but drama (Super)

Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up

Pluto
Help me fight my demons off, know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar, she didn't wanna leave
Treat her like garbage, my heart was on my sleeve
Should've chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep?
Why should I have trust for you? You ain't get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you? You ain't kneelin' to my feet
Why should I be carin' when I know I can't be beat?
See how the ice be glarin' when I come through and retrieve
It's easy to know it's us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes, I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket, you niggas beneath me
Who causin' a racket in Jamaica on the weekend?
Half a ticket on vacation, I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy 'cause my money long like Stevie
Stay down with my son, right or wrong, FBG shit (Freebandz)
How you gon' be gang? You bang if you rich, what's in your bloodline?
Come in with some Talibans, everythin' gettin' gunned down
Halloween gang in this bitch, shit gettin' scary
Three hundred thousand for the cheapest ring, cost a Bentley truck, I'm legendary, lil' bitch
Hot, off the thermometer, lil' bitch
Hotter than fish grease, lil' bitch
My ring cost a big B as well as my wrist
I'm gettin' money like this, can't tell problems exist
I wake up fresh every day like I'm goin' to take a pic
Hermes hit my main line 'cause they know I'm lit
Stuffed a hundred-fifty racks in your purse, lil' bitch
And when I wake up, go surf in your pussy, hit

Say she wanna eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Switchin' up my bitch, I leveled up and went exotic
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't buyin' a Birkin for your mama?
You can die today, I swear I still won't break my promise (Pluto)

Make love on the weekend as usual
Take drugs, goin' up, oh, that's usual
Every time she come, big spender
Every time I put my chains on, big spender

It's cool, man, got red bottoms on
Life is good, you know what I mean? Like


Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since

I can't entertain all that flodgin'
I ain't been the same since they crossed me
You know how they do when you poppin'
You know Baby can't do all that talkin'
I got fools tryna sue up in Boston
I got dudes tryna sue down in Florida
I got hoes in L.A., got a new boo from Georgia
A milli', saved up to give to my daughter
Over one hundred K to Drew Findling, my lawyer (Let's go)
Six digits on cases, we beat it like Tina (Mmh)
Baby all on the TV, that's easy
I mixed mid with the gas and I bought me a Bimmer (Yeah)
Now I pull up in Ghosts, they ain't see me (Casper)
I know she gon' fuck, I ain't askin' (Uh-huh)
F&N like a prop, this shit plastic (Phew)
Fuck around and get popped just for laughin' (Boom)
Put that boy in a box, pick a casket
I go take that ho to Dior, pick a shoe (Let's go)
Kickin' shit with your whore, that's my boo
You can go put hardwood on the floor with the hoop (Hoop)
We like uppin' the score, we gon' shoot (Ball)

Help the bitch start a business, she bossin' (Uh-huh)
Like to wake up to sex like it's coffee (Sex)
Big baguettes on my neck, this shit cost me
Cartier, Audemar, Audemar or the Rolex (Let's go)

When she walk through the door, take that iron, make her hold that (Hold that)
They ain't seen me go out like a ho yet (Ho)
You know these lil' niggas got ho ways
Make 'em come air it out like the old days (Uh-huh)

Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo

Spent thirty racks on a rap bitch, could've went and bought a brick, woah
Quarter million worth of chains, ask Icebox, everybody lit, woah
It ain't no coppin' deuces, nigga, that's your man, everybody get it, woah
Made a few mil', made a few hits, fuckin' everybody bitch
Got somethin' to lose so I stay with a shooter
Got game from a GOAT, I know how to maneuver
She kinda cute, really somethin' to do
I got somethin' to do, so I gave her to Pluto, huh
Hundred thousand for a body, go inside the house and everybody get it, huh
Got a plug on exotic, overnight 'em, floodin' everybody's city
Extra three-fifty, might buy me a Richie
This shit gettin' ridiculous, sip syrup wrong, get sick
Spot in Toronto, just show me the real ones
Give me a few months, I'll be servin' the 6, woah
Rolls truck, four bucks, all white guts, call it good luck, woah
Neck lit, wrist lit, look, don't touch, reach, you get busted
Hop out a Phantom, they think it's Houdini
Seven-fifty one day, I bought two Lamborghinis
Hundred racks spent on a four carat diamond
I didn't propose, but I bought her a ring
They had my bro, had to let that boy go
He had stick to the code, he ain't tell 'em a thing, uh
Ballin' like we won a championship, yeah
Everybody get a ring, huh

Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since, woo

Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch

My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying?
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a kingpin, you heard?

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe

Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, ""They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one""
We going back in soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him into custody, they took my life away

People didn't even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this...
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
That's when I did Beast Mode

I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggys
I endured so much pain, ain't got 'Sco with me
Ain't got nobody to smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealin' with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag, we gettin' back to the paper
Gettin' back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hatin'
I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick layin' on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doin' some real life porno

And I ain't worried 'bout nothin' in the world, keep a badass bitch

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga

And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give 'em what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the cut, they just know me from rhymin'
My hard work finally catchin' up with perfect timin'

You know what I'm saying
I could take a hundred dollar slab

I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I'm on the phone with Yo, I ask him how the trial went
Thirty-five racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting, you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened, they was hating on us
You know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us
Ayy, this a letter for my dawgs, how we let the money get between us?
How we let these bitches get between us?
How we let these niggas get between us?
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India

Got lil' shawty with me, she a pro
Know she'll never meet another nigga, not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars, he can't make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented

Told 'em I'm through with the pies

Codeine sippin', Versace, I'm grippin'
Them bands in my pocket, you know that I’m livin'
I'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs: that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I'm the don but no Rocco
This the life that I chose
Bought out the store, can't go back no more
Versace my clothes while I'm sellin' them bows
Versace take over, it took out my soul

The dope that I sell is the purest
The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'

Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic

Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'
(I don't know how you feel can you tell me?)
I know why you came in this club tonight
Looking for a nigga that's gon' change your life

I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl (With you)

Migos,Cross the Country,"November 5, 2014","Young rich nigga riding round the city with the mac
Take a chopper, and a chicken, now watch the leakin' (ba-bow)
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget (nah, for real)
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about? (Shit)
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
Tray 1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a hot boy, so you know I gotta stay low (hot)
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet (vet)
'Set told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check (do it)
I'm a young nigga with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out ""Free Actavis""
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental
Trap, trap dab when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick come with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T, pity the fool
Master P, No Limit money, bando jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got Playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me 'til a nigga be cumming

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets is the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger turn into the Terminator

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: that's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga with a pot of gold like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire like Megatron
QC the label, Migo the gang
Already told you, I want the M&Ms, fuck the fame
No shame in the game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Luol Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta tuck the chain
Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country"

But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away"

Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

I just keep on hopin' that you call me

And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

Got ""Malone"" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace"

Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold fifteen million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me

I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

Too bad for you
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

Yeah, we fight and we fuck until we open the cuts
And now we're soberin' up but never sober enough

And it's gonna break my heart
When she gives hers to you
And it won't be tomorrow
But it's gonna be too soon
When I walk her down that aisle and do what daddies have to do

And she might be wearin' white
But her first dress, it was pink
She might be your better half
Yeah, but she's my everything
We'll both love her forever
But I loved her long before
And one day, I know I'll give her away
Buddy, that don't mean she's yours
Mm

Yesterday, she said her first word
She's a long way from ""I do""
Right now she runs to me
One day, she'll run to you
And it's gonna be your best day
But it's gonna be my worst
You might watch her walkin' towards you, but I saw her walkin' first

Told my auntie, ""Put them 'Ports down, them 'Ports down""
Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin', nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they countin' on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm stylin' on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm drivin' too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Just this guy from north of the border, my chips is in order
My mom's biggest supporter, so now a nigga support a nigga

You just like going to Heaven (My heart)
More than anything (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
I'm fallin' and I'm drownin'
But you're takin' me

One thousand on my feet, stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (Eyes)

Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' no FaceTime
50K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Latе from the country caters
No peacеmaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
I need no beef, no cheese (Yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (Uh)
Every time we meet, naive

When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever

Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me a smile (Hah)
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it for miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror (That shit wild)
I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink"

Don't have words with me 'cause I got a mind filled
I could tell Larry David was the mind behind Seinfeld
Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield
Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills
Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos
Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati, next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?
Never trust a bartender that don't drink, bitch

Travis Scott,Pornography,"September 4, 2015","Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusin' to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of ""Fuck this shit""
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch, leadin' the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you and fuck this

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surroundin' me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashin' lights—, lights—, lights—
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surroundin' me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashin' lights blindin' me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive or will he fold up?
Livin' like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sits at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say, ""Fuck you""
To the ones who said, ""Fuck you""
'Til you doin' your thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
""La Flame,"" he hears in his head, ""The world is yours"" (Yours, yours)


Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

It's the Rodeo, time to get started, Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects, wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on a auction, but I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus and I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, askin', could you hold one? Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They pickin' you up, but you low down, animated actin' frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them, stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him, but I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom 'til I climb to the top of the podium

So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

She like my show lights, she wanna be wife
She know that if she got me, then she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax
Faster than a hi-hat, sorry, baby, I don't play

Forever been the elephant in the room that everyone can't wait to run and tell about
The head to the body of the belligerent militant group
That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind
""Will he make it? Was it worth it? Did he win? Will he survive the Rodeo?"""

I'm a boss, make sure you and your homies dress up, tight attire
When you see me, ho, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it
I mean, goddamn, nigga
You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from
Where you can't come, where it ain't none
Where these bitches is bitches, and they ain't nuns (What?)
Where they hate from
But as soon as you blow, they act like they been down since day one
Where there's fuckin' tank guns
But niggas never join the army, like it ain't one (Brrt, brrt, brrt)
If I ain't got it, then I'm huntin'
I'm either countin' or I'm cummin' (God)
Swear, I just done bought that mansion
Treat that shit like it's a dungeon

Travis Scott,THANK GOD,"July 28, 2023","I won't doubt it, I won't
He won't mislead all His followers
Prayin' on the process, mind and spirit
Feel like
Like I'm
Floatin' in my prime time

One life, live it right now
One life, live it in

Goodbyes, that's life
Fun times for life
For life, from down my eyes
Thank God I'm free tonight
[Verse 2: Travis Scott & 
Teezo Touchdown

Got God on the line
Tell the devil I'm fine
He always tryin'
Tryin' his best (
No question

Top of the pole
Me and my bros
When the story get told
It's gon' be BMF (
Muchas gracias

This shit sound hard
It wasn't made easy
You can't live twice
Thank God I'm brеathin' (We gon' fuck it up)
We gotta go now

One lifе, live it right now
One life, live it in

Goodbyes, that's life
Fun times for life
For life, from down my eyes
Thank God I breathe tonight (Fuck it up)

Oh

Still no pressure
Thank God, I breathe
'Cause shit I speak is what they need, I tell no lies
I'm still up top, they still can't drop, but what if they not? (Uh)
Yeah (Yeah)
Last tape was filled up with slaps, I guess gotta run this shit back
Didn't like the way that shit went down at the awards, I admit it, it turned to a beast
This that shit right here that get me goin', after I pop me a piece
Way that we killin' the critics and killin' the hate, might gotta talk to a priest
The way we evolved and knocked down walls, this shit's outrageous (Ooh)
A quarterback calls, I don't like 12, except Tom Brady
Can't short my stock, I still stack tall, you still can't trade me
Storm's a minor but you know she livin' major (
That's right, daddy

When you flyin' up this high, it ain't no cables
Shit so lit, what happen in Vegas, it stay in Vegas
Mornin' time, we check the news, we made the papers"
